Experimental Realization of Wheeler's Delayed-Choice Gedanken Experiment[1]1.2.2. Experimental Realization of Wheeler's Delayed-Choice Gedanken Experiment[1]\nWe report the\nrealization of such a delayed-choice experiment\nin a scheme close to the ideal original proposal.\nThe delayed-choice scheme is implemented\nas follows. Linearly polarized single photons are\nsent by a polarization beamsplitter BS input\nthrough an interferometer (length 48 m) with\ntwo spatially separated paths associated with\northogonal S and P polarizations (Fig. 2). The\nmovable output beamsplitter BS output consists of\nthe combination of a half-wave plate, a polarization beamsplitter BS′, an electro-optical modulaor (EOM) with its optical axis oriented at 22.5°\nfrom input polarizations, and a Wollaston prism.\nThe two beams of the interferometer, which are\nspatially separated and orthogonally polarized,\nare first overlapped by BS′ but can still be\nunambiguously identified by their polarization.\nThen, the choice between the two interferometer\nconfigurations, closed or open, is realized with\nthe EOM, which can be switched between two\ndifferent configurations within 40 ns by means of\na homebuilt fast driver: Either no voltage is\napplied to the EOM, or its half-wave voltage V p is\napplied to it. In the first case, the situation\ncorresponds to the removal of BS output and the\ntwo paths remain uncombined (open configuration). Because the original S and P polarizations of the two paths are oriented along prism\npolarization eigenstates, each “click” of one\ndetector D1 or D2 placed on the output ports is\nassociated with a specific path (path 1 or path 2,\nrespectively). When the V p voltage is applied, the\nEOM is equivalent to a half-wave plate that\nrotates the input polarizations by an angle of 45°.\nThe prism then recombines the two rotated\npolarizations that have traveled along different\noptical paths, and interference appears on the two\noutput ports. We then have the closed interferometer configuration.\n \n\nAny description in\nwhich light is treated as a classical wave, such as\nthe semiclassical theory with quantized photo-detectors , predicts that these numbers of\ncounts should obey the inequality\n\n\\alpha=\\frac{N_C\\times N_T}{N_1\\times N_2}\\ge 1\n\nViolation of this inequality thus gives a quantitative criterion that characterizes nonclassical\nbehavior. For a single-photon wavepacket, quantum optics predicts perfect anticorrelation (i.e.,\na = 0) in agreement with the intuitive image that\na single particle cannot be detected simultaneously in the two paths of the interferometer\n(2). We measured a = 0.12 ± 0.01, hence we are\nindeed close to the pure single-photon regime.\nOur realization of Wheeler’s delayed-choice\ngedanken experiment demonstrates that the\nbehavior of the photon in the interferometer\ndepends on the choice of the observable that is\nmeasured, even when that choice is made at a\nposition and a time such that it is separated from\nthe entrance of the photon into the interferometer\nby a space-like interval.\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)Experimental Realization Of Wheeler S Delayed Choice Gedanken Experiment\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"1-Basic knowledge/Measurement of Subpicosecond Time Intervals between Two Photons by Interference.html":{"url":"1-Basic knowledge/Measurement of Subpicosecond Time Intervals between Two Photons by Interference.html","title":"Measurement Of Subpicosecond Time Intervals Between Two Photons By Interference","keywords":"","body":"1.2.3.

Nonlinear parametric photon-pair sources and heralded\nsingle-photon sources (HSPSs) had been the most standard resource of quantum\ninformation applications for decades. However, the intrinsic uncertainty of\nthe produced number of photon pairs in such sources is a critical drawback that\nprevents on-demand photon-pair and heralded single-photon generation. Here\nwe demonstrate large-scale time multiplexing of indistinguishable heralded sin-\ngle photons, employing a low-loss HSPS and adjustable delay line. We observed\n66.7±2.4% presence probability of single-photon states collected into a singlemode optical fiber by multiplexing 40 periodic time bins of heralded single pho-\ntons. To our knowledge, this is the highest fiber-coupled single-photon probabil-\nity achieved to date. A high indistinguishability (∼90%) of our time-multiplexed\nphotons has also been confirmed. We also experimentally investigate trade-off\nrelations of single-photon probability and unwanted multiphoton contribution\nby using different pump powers for a HSPS. Our results demonstrate that low-loss, large-scale multiplexing can realize highly efficient single-photon generation\nas well as highly scalable multi-photon generation from inefficient HSPSs. We\npredict that our large-scale time multiplexing will pave the way toward genera-\ntion of > 30 coincident photons with unprecedented efficiencies, enabling a new\nfrontier in optical quantum information processing.\nIn general multiplexing methods (see Fig. 1a), a twin photon (signal photon) generated by\nmulti-mode, probabilistic SPDC processes is rerouted to a single mode by adaptive opti-\ncal switches controlled in accordance with a mode analysis of the other twin photon (idler\nphoton), whose mode is correlated (or entangled) to that of the “heralded” signal photon.\nIn this case, the single-photon generation probability is no longer constrained by the 25%\nlimit, and can reach as high as a multiplexed heralding probability\n\nP_H=1-(1-p)^N\n\nwhere N is the number of multiplexed modes and p is the probability of a trigger detector\nsignal per mode, i.e., approximately the product of μ and the trigger system detection\nefficiency η T for one SPDC mode.\nThe\ntime-multiplexing technique successfully enhances the single-photon generation probability\nwithout increasing the multi-photon noise relative to the single-photon fraction.\n\n\nHeralded single photons(HSPSs)\nPairs of single photons can be generated in highly correlated states from using a single high-energy photon to create two lower-energy ones. One photon from the resulting pair may be detected to 'herald' the other (so its state is pretty well known prior to detection). The two photons need not generally be the same wavelength, but the total energy and resulting polarisation are defined by the generation process.\nThere are two commonly used types of heralded single-photon sources: spontaneous parametric down-conversion and spontaneous four-wave mixing. The first source has line-width around THz and the second one has line-width around MHz or narrower. \n\nSecond harmonic generation(SHG) \nSecond harmonic generation (SHG, also called frequency doubling) is a nonlinear optical process in which two photons with the same frequency interact with a nonlinear material, are \"combined\", and generate a new photon with twice the energy of the initial photons \n\nPeriodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate (PPKTP)\nPotassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) is an inorganic compound with the formula KTiOPO4. It is a white solid.

It can be wavelength tailored for efficient second harmonic generation, sum frequency generation, and difference frequency generation. The interactions in PPKTP are based upon quasi-phase-matching, achieved by periodic poling of the crystal, whereby a structure of regularly spaced ferroelectric domains with alternating orientations are created in the material.\nPPKTP is commonly used for Type 1 & 2 frequency conversions for pump wavelengths of 730-3500 nm.\n\ndichroic mirror(DM)\nA dichroic filter, thin-film filter, or interference filter is a very accurate color filter used to selectively pass light of a small range of colors while reflecting other colors.

The new source allowed ready preparation of all\nfour of the EPR-Bell states.\nTo date, most of the experiments with photons from\nspontaneous parametric down conversion have used type-I\nphase matching, in which the correlated photons have the\nsame polarization.

With type-II\nphase matching, the down—converted photons are emitted\ninto two cones, one ordinary polarized, the other\nextraordinary polarized. In the collinear situation\nthe two cones are tangent to one another on exactly one\nline, namely, the pump beam direction. If 6pm is\ndecreased, the two cones will separate from each other\nentirely. However, if the angle is increased, the two\ncones tilt toward the pump, causing an intersection along\ntwo lines (see Fig. 1). Along the two directions\n(“1” and “2”), where the cones overlap, the light can be\nessentially described by an entangled state:\n\n|\\psi \\rangle=(|H_1,V_2 \\rangle+e^{i \\alpha}|V_1,H_2 \\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}\n\nwhere H and V indicate horizontal (extraordinary) and\nvertical (ordinary) polarization, respectively.

For each experimental outcome, we\ncalculate the ratio of the expected probabilities for indistinguishable and\ndistinguishable photons. If the ratio is close to one, up to a threshold\nk_1, the event is considered to be inconclusive and D is left\nunchanged. These inconclusive events, however, are still counted as a resource and\ndo contribute to the effective number of events required to discriminate the two distributions. If 1/k_1 ≤ p^{ind}_i /q_i^{dis}  , the event is assigned to the boson sampler\ndis\nby adding +1 to D. If the ratio between the two probabilities is high, p^{ind}_i /q_i^{dis} ≥ k_2 ,\nthe event is assigned to the boson sampler by adding +2 to D, thus reflecting the\nhigher level of confidence in this case. Conversely, if 1/k_2  and\np^{ind}_i /q_i^{dis} ≤ 1/k_2 the event is assigned to the distinguishable sampler by adding -1 and -2  to D, respectively.

Interference of two particles\n1.4.2.1.1. Distinguishable particles: uncorrelated binomial behaviour\nAny incoming particle is reflected with probability R and transmitted with probability T = 1 -R. An event with s_1 and s_2 particles in the first and second output mode, respectively, occurs with probability P_D (s_1 , s_2 ). In particular, for a balanced setup, T = R = 1/2, the distribution of distinguishable particles in the output modes follows a binomial, and \n\nP_D (2, 0) = \\frac{1}{4} , P_D (1, 1) = \\frac{1}{2} , P_D (0, 2) = \\frac{1}{4}\n\n1.4.2.1.2.

Two-particle distinguishability transition\nTwo partially distinguishable bosons\nAs a realistic\nexample for such transition, we consider photons and choose\nthe time of arrival at the beam splitter as the degree of\nfreedom through which the indistinguishability of the light\nquanta may be affected. In quantum optics experiments ,\nthe relative delay in the arrival time is manipulated by the\nspatial displacement of the wave-packets to the beam splitter.\nThe resulting event probability for partially distinguish-\nable particles becomes the average of the probabilities assigned\nto bosons and to distinguishable particles, weighted by |c_{2,1}|^2\nand |c_{2,2}|^2 , respectively: \n\nP_T(\\vec{s}=(s_1,s_2),x)=|c_{2,1}|^2P_B(s_1,s_2)+|c_{2,2}|^2P_D(s_1,s_2)\n\nTo model typical experiments with photons , a\nGaussian frequency distribution around a central frequency\n\\omega_0 with width \\Delta \\omega is assumed,\n\n|t_j\\rangle=\\int\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{d}\\omega\\frac{1}{\\pi^{1/4}\\Delta\\omega^{1/2}}e^{-\\frac{(\\omega-\\omega_0)^2}{2\\Delta\\omega^2}}e^{i\\omega t_j}|\\omega\\rangle\n\nThe temporal overlap of two photons then becomes\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\langle t_j|t_k\\rangle \n& =\\frac{1}{\\pi^{1/2}\\Delta\\omega}\\iint\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{d}\\omega_1\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{d}\\omega_2 e^{-\\frac{(\\omega_1-\\omega_0)^2+(\\omega_2-\\omega_0)^2}{2\\Delta\\omega^2}}e^{i\\omega_1 t_j+i\\omega_2 t_k}\\langle\\omega_1|\\omega_2\\rangle\n\n\n\n\n\\\\ & =\\frac{1}{\\pi^{1/2}\\Delta\\omega}\\int\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{d}\\omega_2 e^{-\\frac{(\\omega_2-\\omega_0)^2}{\\Delta\\omega^2}}e^{i\\omega_2 (t_j+t_k)}\n \n\n\n\\\\ & =e^{i(t_k-t_j)\\omega_0}e^{-\\frac{(t_j-t_k)^2}{4}\\Delta\\omega^2}\n\\end{align}\n\nThe visibility of the HOM-dip constitutes today the defacto standard for ensuring the indistinguishability of two bosonic particles in the experiment.\nBy post-selecting events with a well-defined total number\nof photons N, i.e. by neglecting all final events in which the\ntotal number of detected photons does not match the desired\nN, one can effectively project with high fidelity onto the\ncomponent with a total of N light quanta in the initial state.\n1.4.2.1.4.

Indeed, a quantitative indicator for\nentanglement, the concurrence\n\nC=|c_{2,1}|\n\ndirectly reflects the indistinguishability\nRelying on propagation and detection for entanglement\nmanipulation also leads to natural constraints on operations.\nFor example, a measurement that fully discriminates all four\nBell states is impossible, which inhibits deterministic\nteleportation, for which nonlinear interactions are\nnecessary.\n1.4.2.2.

Its applications range from\nfundamental tests of quantum mechanics to photonic quantum information processing, where a\nsignificant fraction of key experiments achieved so far comes from multi-photon state manipulation. We review the progress, both theoretical and experimental, of this rapidly advancing\nresearch. The emphasis is given to the creation of photonic entanglement of various forms, tests\nof the completeness of quantum mechanics (in particular, violations of local realism), quantum\ninformation protocols for quantum communication (e.g., quantum teleportation, entanglement purification and quantum repeater), and quantum computation with linear optics. We shall limit the\nscope of our review to “few photon” phenomena involving measurements of discrete observables.\n1.4.3.2. INTERFERENCE AND QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT\nWe discuss here the basic differences between the classical interference understood as interference of electro-magnetic\nwaves in space, and the quantum one which is interference of various operationally indistinguishable processes.\n1.4.3.2.1. Classical interference\nConsider two quasi-monochromatic plane waves linearly polarized in the same direction, described by\n\nE_j(\\mathbf{r},t)==E_je^{i[\\mathbf{k_j}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\omega t- \\phi_j(t) ]}+c.c.\n\nfinally c.c. denotes\nthe complex conjugate of the previous expression. The\nintensity of the superposed fields at a certain point in\nspace is given by\n\nI(\\mathbf{r},t)=E_1^2+E_2^2+2E_1E_2\\cos[\\Delta_{12}\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\Delta_{12} \\phi(t)]\n\nThe Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiment introduced\nintensity correlation measurements to optics. Such correlations between two points in space and two moments of\ntime, for two classical fields are described by an intensity\ncorrelation function\n\nG^{(2)}(\\mathbf{r_1},t_1;\\mathbf{r_2},t_2)= \\langle I(\\mathbf{r_1},t_1)I(\\mathbf{r_2},t_2) \\rangle_{av}\n\nThe average is taken over an ensemble, and for stationary fields this is equivalent to the temporal average. Even\nwhen no intensity variations are observable (i.e., for averaged intensity constant in space), the intensity correlations can reveal interference effects. Assume that the\nphases of the two fields fluctuate independently of one\nanother. Then for t_1 = t_2 , the G^{(2)} function still ex-hibits a spatial modulation or maximal visibility of 50%\nas exhibited by the formula:\n\nG^{(2)}(\\mathbf{r},t;\\mathbf{r},t)=(I_1+I_2)^2+2I_1I_2\\cos[(\\Delta_{12}\\mathbf{k})(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})]\n\nwhere I_i = E_i^2 , i = 1, 2. This formula can be easily\nreached by noting that the temporal average of\n\n\\cos[\\alpha+\\Delta_{12}\\phi(t)]\\cos[\\alpha'+\\delta_{12}\\phi(t)]=\\frac{1}{2}[\\cos(\\alpha- \\alpha')+\\cos(\\alpha+\\alpha'+2 \\Delta_{12}\\phi(t))]\n\nwhere \\Delta_{12}\\phi(t))=\\phi_1(t)-\\phi_2(t) , is given by\n\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cos(\\alpha- \\alpha')+\\frac{1}{2}\\langle\\cos(\\alpha+\\alpha'+2 \\Delta_{12}\\phi(t))\\rangle_{av}\n\nand due to the random nature of \\Delta_{12}\\phi(t))only the first term survive\nThus, the\nvisibility of intensity correlations for fields with fluctuat-\ning phase differences is never full, maximally 50%.\n1.4.3.2.2. Quantum interference\nSingle-particle quantum interference\nIn the classical particle picture one would expect that a process originating with state A and with possible intermediate stages B_1 , \\dots ,B_N , leading to an event\nC, would be described by\n\nP(C|A)=\\sum^N_{j=1}P(C|B_j)P(B_j|A)\\tag{C}\n\nIn the quantum case P(C|A)=| \\langle C|A \\rangle|^2,where\n\n\\langle C|A \\rangle=\\sum^N_{j=1} \\langle C|B_j \\rangle \\langle B_j|A \\rangle\\tag{Q}\n\nThe difference between (C) and (Q) is in the assumption, inherent in (C), that the particle had to be in one\nof the intermediate situations (states) B_i . In the quantum case any attempt to verify by measurement 5 which\nof the situations actually took place puts one back to the\nclassical formula (C). The formula (Q) leads to interference phenomena, and may be thought as a manifestation\nof a wave nature of quantum particles, whereas, if we\nmake measurements discriminating events B_i , we learn\nby which way (welcher weg) the particles travel. The\n“which-way information”is a clear signature of the particle nature.\nTwo-particle quantum interference\nConsider such a correlation: assume that if particle 1\nis at b_1 , then particle 2 is also at b_1 , and, whenever 1\nis at b_2 then particle 2 is at b_2 . Later on the particles\nare detected at two different points, \\mathbf{x_1} and \\mathbf{x_2} . Then,\naccording to the rules given above\n\n\\begin{align}\nP(\\mathbf{x_1},\\mathbf{x_2},t)&\\sim|A_{b_1}(\\mathbf{x_1},t)A_{b_1}(\\mathbf{x_2},t)+A_{b_2}(\\mathbf{x_1},t)A_{b_2}(\\mathbf{x_2},t)|^2\\\\\n&\\sim 1+\\cos(\\Delta\\mathbf{k_1}\\cdot\\mathbf{x_1}+\\Delta\\mathbf{k_2}\\cdot\\mathbf{x_2}+\\Delta \\Phi_{b_1,b_2})\n\\end{align}\n\nThus, if the phase relation between the two\namplitudes is stable one can have absolutely noiseless interference with 100% visibility, while there is no single particle interference:\n\nP(\\mathbf{x_1},t)=\\int d\\mathbf{x_2}P(\\mathbf{x_1},\\mathbf{x_2},t)=const\n\nAs we shall see, the unbounded visibility is not the only\nfeature by which two-particle interference differs from\nclassical one.(It seems that this paragraph is trying to compare the visibility between classical cases and quantum cases, but there may be some logic flaws, because it wants to compare the visibility of G^{(2)} with that of probablity)\n1.4.3.2.3. Quantum entanglement\n\n| \\psi \\rangle _ { 12 } = \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } ( | \\uparrow \\rangle _ { 1 } | \\downarrow \\rangle _ { 2 } - | \\downarrow \\rangle _ { 1 } | \\uparrow \\rangle _ { 2 } )\n\nwhere, e.g., | \\uparrow \\rangle _ { 1 }  | \\downarrow \\rangle _ { 1 } ) describes the state of particle 1\nwith its spin up (down) along the z-direction. The minus sign is necessary to get the rotational invariance.\nThe spin state of one of the particles is described\nby a reduced density operator 6 , which is a totally random state \\frac { 1 } { 2 } I _ { k } and I _ { k } = | \\uparrow \\rangle _ { k k } \\langle \\uparrow | + | \\downarrow \\rangle _ { k k } \\langle \\downarrow |is the unit operator for a\ngiven subsystem. \nA hermitian operator \\hat { W } is an entanglement witness if for\nall separable states one has \\operatorname { Tr } \\left( \\hat { W } \\varrho _ { \\operatorname { sep } } \\right) \\geq 0, whereas there\nexists an entangled state for which one has \\operatorname { Tr } \\left( \\hat { W } \\varrho _ { \\operatorname { sep } } \\right) . Thus, via measurement of a suitably chosen witness\noperator one can detect entanglement.\n1.4.3.2.4. Interferometry with entangled two- and multi-photon states\nEPR interferometry\n \nWe assume that a central\nsource emits two photons in an entangled state\n\n| \\psi \\rangle _ { 12 } = \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } ( | a \\rangle _ { 1 } | a ^ { \\prime } \\rangle _ { 2 } + | b \\rangle _ { 1 } | b ^ { \\prime } \\rangle _ { 2 } )\n\nBy taking into account the phase shifts \\phi_1 and \\phi_2(The terms times \\phi_i respectively) and\nthe action of the two beamsplitters(|a \\rangle\\to\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(i|c \\rangle+|d \\rangle),|b \\rangle\\to\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|c \\rangle+i|d \\rangle)), the probabilities of\nthe coincidence detections of two photons at the detector\npairs (\\mathrm { D } _ { 1 c / d } , \\mathrm { D } _ { 2 c / d }​ ) read\n\n\\begin{aligned} p _ { 1 c , 2 d } \\left( \\phi _ { 1 } , \\phi _ { 2 } \\right) & = p _ { 1 d , 2 c } \\left( \\phi _ { 1 } , \\phi _ { 2 } \\right) = \\frac { 1 } { 4 } \\left[ 1 + \\cos \\left( \\phi _ { 1 } - \\phi _ { 2 } \\right) \\right] \\\\ p _ { 1 c , 2 c } \\left( \\phi _ { 1 } , \\phi _ { 2 } \\right) & = p _ { 1 d , 2 d } \\left( \\alpha , \\phi _ { 2 } \\right) = \\frac { 1 } { 4 } \\left[ 1 - \\cos \\left( \\phi _ { 1 } - \\phi _ { 2 } \\right) \\right] \\end{aligned}\n\nThus, by simultaneously monitoring the detectors on\nboth sides of the interferometer, while varying the phase\nshifts \\phi_1 and \\phi_2​, the interference fringes will be observed\nas shown by the sinusoidal terms. In contrast, for any single detector the count rate shows no interference at all.\nGHZ interferometry\n\n\n| \\mathrm { GHZ } \\rangle _ { 123 } = \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } ( | a \\rangle _ { 1 } | a ^ { \\prime } \\rangle _ { 2 } | a ^ { \\prime \\prime } \\rangle _ { 3 } + | b \\rangle _ { 1 } | b ^ { \\prime } \\rangle _ { 2 } | b ^ { \\prime \\prime } \\rangle _ { 3 } )\n\n\n\\begin{aligned} p _ { 1 c , 2 c , 3 c } \\left( \\phi _ { 1 } , \\phi _ { 2 } , \\phi _ { 3 } \\right) & = \\frac { 1 } { 8 } \\left[ 1 + \\sin \\left( \\phi _ { 1 } + \\phi _ { 2 } + \\phi _ { 3 } \\right) \\right] \\\\ p _ { 1 d , 2 c , 3 c } \\left( \\phi _ { 1 } , \\phi _ { 2 } , \\phi _ { 3 } \\right) & = \\frac { 1 } { 8 } \\left[ 1 - \\sin \\left( \\phi _ { 1 } + \\phi _ { 2 } + \\phi _ { 3 } \\right) \\right] , \\text { etc. } \\end{aligned}\n\n1.4.3.3. PHOTONIC QUBITS AND LINEAR OPTICS\nA general (normalized) basis state of the Fock space is of the following form:\n\n| n _ { 1 } , n _ { 2 } , n _ { 3 } , \\ldots \\rangle = \\prod _ { l = 1 } ^ { \\infty } \\frac { \\hat { a } _ { l } ^ { \\dagger n _ { l } } } { \\sqrt { n ! } } | \\Omega \\rangle\n\nIt is easy to see that if one defines the creation\noperators with respect to an alternative basis of wave\npacket profiles (here the primed ones) one has:\n\n\\hat { a } _ { m } ^ { \\prime \\dagger } = \\sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \\infty } U _ { m n } \\hat { a } _ { n } ^ { \\dagger }\n\n1.4.3.3.1. Photonic qubits\nA quantum bit, or qubit, is the most elementary unit\nof quantum information. It is a generalization of the\nclassical bit, which has two distinguishable states “0”\nand “1”. Similarly, we can have a qubit in two distinguishable, i.e., orthogonal states | 0 \\rangle and | 1 \\rangle. However, in\ncontradistinction to its classical counterpart, a qubit can\nbe prepared as, or transformed to, any superposition of\nthese two states (normalization requires \\alpha _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } + \\alpha _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } = 1):\n\n| \\Psi _ { \\text { qubit } } \\rangle = \\alpha _ { 0 } | 0 \\rangle + \\alpha _ { 1 } | 1 \\rangle\n\nAny isolated two-level system consisting of a pair of\northogonal quantum states represents a qubit.\n\nPolarization qubits  they can easily be created and\nmanipulated with high precision by simple linear-optical\nelements such as polarizing beam splitters (PBS), polarizers and wave plates.\nSpatial qubits Any state of spatial qubits can be prepared by\nusing suitable phase shifters and BSs. A disadvantage\nof using spatial qubits is that the coherence between |a \\rangle\nand |b \\rangle is sensitive to the relative phase between the paths\na and b, and this is difficult to control in long-distance\ncases.\nTime-bin qubits\n\nTwo-photon polarization entangled states. The so-\ncalled Bell states 14 form a basis in the four dimensional\ntwo-qubit Hilbert space. Bell states of photonic polarization qubits can be for example:\n\n\\begin{aligned} | \\psi ^ { \\pm } \\rangle _ { 12 } & = \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } ( | H \\rangle _ { 1 } | V \\rangle _ { 2 } \\pm | V \\rangle _ { 1 } | H \\rangle _ { 2 } ) \\\\ | \\phi ^ { \\pm } \\rangle _ { 12 } & = \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } ( | H \\rangle _ { 1 } | H \\rangle _ { 2 } \\pm | V \\rangle _ { 1 } | V \\rangle _ { 2 } ) \\end{aligned}\n\n1.4.3.3.2. Simple linear-optical elements\nIn the photonic domain, quantum states of photons can\nbe easily, and with a high precision, manipulated by simple passive linear-optical devices. These linear-optical elements include BS, polarizing beamsplitter (PBS), wave\nplates and phase shifters. Classically, such devices conserve energy: The total input energy equals the total\noutput energy, and there is no energy transfer between\ndifferent frequencies. A passive linear optical device is\ndescribed by a unitary transformation of annihilation operators for the same frequency:\n\n\\hat { a } _ { m } ^ { o u t } = \\sum _ { m } U _ { m n } \\hat { a } _ { n } ^ { i n }\n\nwhere U is a unitary matrix, and the indices denote a\nbasis of orthogonal modes.\nThe BS is one of the most important optical elements.The most commonly used BS is the symmetric 50:50 BS characterized by the\nfollowing transformation\n\n\\begin{array} { c } { \\hat { a } \\longrightarrow \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } \\hat { c } + \\frac { i } { \\sqrt { 2 } } \\hat { d } } \\\\ { \\hat { b } \\longrightarrow \\frac { i } { \\sqrt { 2 } } \\hat { c } + \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } \\hat { d } } \\end{array}\n\nThe factor i is a consequence of unitarity. It describes a phase jump upon reflection\n\nAnother important component is the polarizing beam-splitter (PBS)\n\n\\hat { a } _ { H } \\rightarrow \\hat { c } _ { H } \\text { and } \\hat { a } _ { V } \\rightarrow i \\hat { d } _ { V } ; \\quad \\hat { b } _ { H } \\rightarrow \\hat { d } _ { H } \\text { and } \\hat { b } _ { V } \\rightarrow i \\hat { c } _ { V }\n\n\n1.4.3.3.3. Two-photon interference due to indistinguishability of photons\nAs we have seen previously, upon reflection off a symmetric 50:50 BS a photon picks a phase shift i. Denote\nthe input modes as a and b and output modes as c and d.\nIf we have two spectrally identical photons (of the same\npolarization) each entering at exactly the same moment\nan opposite input port of the BS, the initial state \\hat { a } ^ { \\dagger } \\hat { b } ^ { \\dagger } | \\Omega \\rangle,\nis transformed into\n\n\\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } \\left( \\hat { c } ^ { \\dagger } + i \\hat { d } ^ { \\dagger } \\right) \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } \\left( \\hat { d } ^ { \\dagger } + i \\hat { c } ^ { \\dagger } \\right) | \\Omega \\rangle \\rightarrow \\frac { i } { 2 } \\left( \\hat { c } ^ { \\dagger 2 } + \\hat { d } ^ { \\dagger 2 } \\right) | \\Omega \\rangle\n\nWe have a cancellation of the two terms, \\hat { c } \\hat { d } - \\hat { d } \\hat { c } = 0\nwhich describe the cases in which each photon exits by a\ndifferent exit port. This cancellation occurs if the two\nphotons are perfectly indistinguishable in terms of all\ntheir other degrees of freedom such as frequency, time,\nor polarization.\nIf the photons are at least partially distinguishable (in\nthis case we shall label the annihilation operators of the\nphotons with different subscripts as \\hat { a } _ { 1 } and \\hat { b } _ { 2 } ) the initial\nstate \\hat { a } _ { 1 } ^ { \\dagger } \\hat { b } _ { 2 } ^ { \\dagger } | \\Omega \\rangle is transformed by a perfect 50:50 BS via\nthe relations in Eqn.28 into\n\n\\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } \\left( \\hat { c } _ { 1 } ^ { \\dagger } + i \\hat { d } _ { 1 } ^ { \\dagger } \\right) \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } \\left( \\hat { d } _ { 2 } ^ { \\dagger } + i \\hat { c } _ { 2 } ^ { \\dagger } \\right) | \\Omega \\rangle\n\n1.4.3.3.4. Post-selection of entanglement and quantum erasure\n\nWhen analyzing the above experiments, one could be\nmislead to suppose that the interference arises due to the fact that the wave packets of the two photons overlap at\nthe BS. However, it is important to note that essentially, the origin of this interference is due to the indistinguishability\nof two-photon amplitudes describing the various alternatives leading to a coincidence count. To dispel a misconception that the photons must arrive at the BS at the\nsame time for some type of classical local “agreement”,\nPittman et al. (1996) performed a “postponed compensation” two-photon Shih-Alley type experiment. Interference is observed, even though the photons were arriving\nat the BS at different times.\n1.4.3.3.5. Entangled-state analyzers\n\nBell-state analyzer\nSpecifically, for the incident state \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } ( | H \\rangle _ { a } | H \\rangle _ { b } + | V \\rangle _ { a } | V \\rangle _ { b } ) we always observe\na coincidence either between detectors \\mathrm { D } _ { H 1 } and \\mathrm { D } _ { H 2 } or\n\\mathrm { D } _ { V1 } and \\mathrm { D } _ { V2 } . On the other hand, if the incident state is\n\\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } ( | H \\rangle _ { a } | H \\rangle _ { b } - | V \\rangle _ { a } | V \\rangle _ { b } ) we observe coincidence at detectors \\mathrm { D } _ { H 1 } and \\mathrm { D } _ { V2 } or \\mathrm { D } _ { V 1 } and \\mathrm { D } _ { H 2 } . The other two\nBell states would lead to no coincidence at detectors in\nmodes 1 and 2.\n1.4.3.3.6. GHZ-state analyzer\nBell state measurement schemes can be generalized to\nthe N-particle case. One can construct a GHZ-state analyzer, with which one can identify two out of the 2^N maximally entangled GHZ states.\nIn the case of three spectrally indistinguishable identical photons, eight maximally entangled polarization GHZ\nstates could be given by\n\n\\begin{aligned} | \\Phi _ { 0 } ^ { \\pm } \\rangle & = \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } ( | H \\rangle | H \\rangle | H \\rangle \\pm | V \\rangle | V \\rangle | V \\rangle ) \\\\ | \\Psi _ { 1 } ^ { \\pm } \\rangle & = \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } ( | V \\rangle | H \\rangle | H \\rangle \\pm | H \\rangle | V \\rangle | V \\rangle ) \\\\ | \\Psi _ { 2 } ^ { \\pm } \\rangle & = \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } ( | H \\rangle | V \\rangle | H \\rangle \\pm | V \\rangle | H \\rangle | V \\rangle ) \\\\ | \\Psi _ { 3 } ^ { \\pm } \\rangle & = \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } ( | H \\rangle | H \\rangle | V \\rangle \\pm | V \\rangle | V \\rangle | H \\rangle ) \\end{aligned}\n\n1.4.3.4. EXPERIMENTAL REALIZATIONS OF PHOTONIC ENTANGLEMENT\n1.4.3.4.1. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion\nIf one shines strong laser light on a nonlinear crystal,\nthe pump photons have some probability to split into correlated pairs of lower energy. This is called spontaneous\nparametric down conversion (SPDC). The new photons,\ncustomarily called “signal” and “idler”, satisfy the following relations: for the wave vectors within the crystal\none has \\mathbf { k } _ { 0 } \\approx \\mathbf { k } _ { i } + \\mathbf { k } _ { s } where subscripts 0, s and i denote,\nrespectively, pump, signal and idler wave vectors, and\nthe respective frequencies satisfy \\omega _ { o } \\approx \\omega _ { i } + \\omega _ { s } . This is\nusually called phase matching.\nThere are two different types of the process:\neither signal and idler photons share the same polarization (type I) or they have perpendicular polarizations\n(type II).\nTypes of entanglement\nPolarization entanglement Currently the standard\nmethod to produce polarization-entangled photons is the\nnoncollinear type-II SPDC process\n\n\\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } ( | H \\rangle _ { A } | V \\rangle _ { B } + e ^ { i \\alpha } | V \\rangle _ { A } | H \\rangle _ { B } )\n\nAfter the compensation, interference\noccurs pairwise between processes in which the photon\npair is created at distances \\pm x from the middle of the\ncrystal. The ideal compensation is therefore to use two\ncrystals, one in each path, which are identical with the\ndown-conversion crystal, but only half as long. If the\npolarizations are rotated by 90^\\circ (e.g., with a half wave\nplate), the retardations of the o and e components are\nexchanged and temporal indistinguishability is restored.\nThe method also provides reasonable compensation for\nthe transverse walk-off effect.\n(WHY?)\n\nTemporal entanglement\n\n\\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } ( | \\operatorname { long } \\rangle _ { 1 } | \\operatorname { long } \\rangle _ { 2 } + e ^ { i \\phi } | \\operatorname { short } \\rangle _ { 1 } | \\text { short } \\rangle _ { 2 } )\n\nAn advantage of the time-bin\nentanglement is that it is insensitive to polarization fluctuations. Using reference laser pulses to actively lock the\nphase, it can be robustly distributed over long distances\nin optical fibers.\n1.4.3.4.2. Photonic entanglement in higher dimensions\nEntangled qudits\nPhotonic entanglement in higher dimensions can in\nprinciple be generated by SPDC processes in a form\nof generalization of path or temporal entanglement into\nmore than two conjugate pairs of beams or time-bins, respectively, and analyzed with N-port beamsplitters\nAnother route is to use the photons' orbital angular momentum.\nHyper-entanglement\nPolarization-path entanglement  Polarization-path entanglement can be generated by a double pass of a pump\nlaser through a BBO crystal. The\npump passes the crystal and is reflected to pass it again.\n\n| \\Psi \\rangle = | \\psi ^ { - } \\rangle _ { \\mathrm { pol } } \\otimes | \\psi ^ { - } ( 0 ) \\rangle _ { \\mathrm { path } }\n\nPolarization-time entanglement   Using a “time-path\ntransmitter” introduced by Chen et al. (2006d), one can\nrealize a transformation between polarization-path and\npolarization-time hyper-entanglement.\nEntanglement in multiple degrees of freedom\nBy pumping two BBO crystals\nwith optical axes aligned in perpendicular planes, a two-photon ( 2 \\otimes 2 ) \\otimes ( 3 \\otimes 3 ) \\otimes ( 2 \\otimes 2 )-dimensional hyperentangled state was produced, approximately described\nby\n\n\\begin{array} { l } { \\underbrace { ( | H H \\rangle + | V V \\rangle ) } _ { \\text { polarization } } \\otimes \\underbrace { ( | 1 , - 1 \\rangle _ { L G } + \\alpha | 0,0 \\rangle _ { L G } + | - 1,1 \\rangle _ { L G } ) } _ { \\text { spatial } } } \\\\ { \\otimes \\underbrace { ( | E E \\rangle + | L L \\rangle ) } _ { \\text { energy-time } } } \\end{array}\n\nHere \\alpha describes the orbital-angular-momentum spatial mode balance which is due the properties of the\nsource and the selection via the\nmode-matching conditions.\n1.4.3.4.3. Twin-beam multi-photon entanglement\nIt is different\nfrom multi-photon entanglement in which each spatially\nseparated photon represents a qubit, and can be individually manipulated and observed.\nA simplified Hamiltonian responsible for generation\nof polarization entangled SPDC photons can be put as\nH _ { 0 } = i \\kappa \\left( a _ { H } ^ { \\dagger } b _ { V } ^ { \\dagger } - a _ { V } ^ { \\dagger } b _ { H } ^ { \\dagger } \\right) + h . c .Horizontally (H) and vertically (V) polarized photons occupy two spatial modes\n(a and b); \\kappa is a coupling constant that depends on\nthe nonlinearity of the crystal and the intensity of the\npump pulse. After the interaction time t the resulting photon state is given by | \\psi \\rangle = e ^ { - i t H _ { 0 } } | 0 \\rangle and in the number state representation reads\n\n\\begin{aligned} | \\psi \\rangle & = \\frac { 1 } { \\cosh ^ { 2 } \\tau } \\sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \\infty } \\sqrt { n + 1 } \\tanh ^ { n } \\tau | \\psi _ { n } ^ { - } \\rangle \\\\ | \\psi _ { n } ^ { - } \\rangle & = \\sum _ { m = 0 } ^ { n } \\frac { ( - 1 ) ^ { m } } { \\sqrt { n + 1 } } | n - m , m ; m , n - m \\rangle \\end{aligned}\n\nA special twin-beam entanglement is the so-called\n“high NOON” type state of two\nbeams:\n\n| \\mathrm { NOON } \\rangle = | N , 0 ; 0 , N \\rangle = \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 } } ( | N \\rangle _ { a } | 0 \\rangle _ { b } + | 0 \\rangle _ { a } | N \\rangle _ { b } )\n\nThese experiments demonstrated an interesting feature of NOON states: the effective de Broglie\nwavelength of the multiphoton state is by 1/N shorter\nthan the wavelength of the single photon\n1.4.3.4.4. Multi-photon entanglement\nEntanglement construction\nEntangling two independent particles: the principle. \n\nNote that depending on the phase shifts the detection at, e.g., c(+) and\nd(+), acts like a Bell-state measurement, projecting the\n\u0001\ntwo photons into the state  \n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}( |c^{\\prime}\\rangle | d^{\\prime} \\rangle+e^{i\\left(\\phi_{c}+\\phi_{d}\\right)} | c \\rangle | d \\rangle )\n .\nThe other two photons are, due\n\u0001 to this event, in state:\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}( |b^{\\prime}\\rangle | a^{\\prime} \\rangle+e^{-i\\left(\\phi_{c}+\\phi_{d}\\right)} | b \\rangle | a \\rangle )\n. This process is called entanglement swapping.\nEnforcing source indistinguishability.\nOne could determine that the photon detected at d(+)\ncame from crystal A (B) by noting the near simultaneity\nof the detection of photon d(+) and one of the photons\nat a(+) or b(+)\nNew methods\nA method gaining great importance is tuning the properties of the downconversion source and the pump such\nthat one obtains frequency uncorrelated pairs of photons\nFirst proposals\nssume that sources A and B\nsimultaneously emit a photon pair each. Pairs in beams\nx, y (1, 3, and 2, 4) are in identical polarization states\n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}( |H_{x}, H_{y}\\rangle+| V_{x}, V_{y} \\rangle )\n . The state of the four particles,\n2\nafter the passage of 2 and 3 via PBS1, and provided the\nphotons are indistinguishable (which can be secured using the methods as described earlier), reads\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\frac{1}{2}( |H_{1}, H_{2}, H_{3}, H_{4}\\rangle+| V_{1}, V_{2}, V_{3}, V_{4}} \\rangle\\\\ {+| H_{1}, H_{3}, V_{3}, V_{4} \\rangle+| V_{1}, V_{2}, H_{2}, H_{4}}\\rangle)\\end{array}\n\nOnly the superposition | H_{1}, H_{2}, H_{3}, H_{4} \\rangle+| V_{1}, V_{2}, V_{3}, V_{4} \\rangle, Only the superposition , which is a GHZ state, leads to four-fold coincidence. Therefore, four-fold coincidences can reveal four-particle GHZ correlations. which is a GHZ state, leads to four-fold coincidence.\nTherefore, four-fold coincidences can reveal four-particle\nGHZ correlations.\n\nDue to the absence of perfect pair sources\nand perfect single photon detectors, in the experiments\nboth three- and four-photon entanglement is observed only under the condition that there is one and only one photon\nin each of the four outputs.\n1.4.3.5. FALSIFICATION OF A REALISTIC WORLD VIEW\nRealism, the cornerstone of classical physics, is a view\nthat for any physical system (also a subsystem of a compound system), one can find a theoretical description (deterministic or probabilistic) which involves all results of\nall possible experiments that can be performed upon it\nno matter which experiment actually was performed. Evidently, this directly contradicts the Bohr's complementarity principle. A theory is local if it assumes that information, and influences, cannot travel faster than light.\n1.4.3.5.1. Bell's inequality\nThe following inequalities must be satisfied for\nlocal realistic descriptions\n\n-4 \\leq \\sum_{s_{1}=\\pm 1, s_{2}=\\pm 1} S\\left(s_{1}, s_{2}\\right)\\left[E\\left(A_{1}, B_{1}\\right)+s_{2} E\\left(A_{1}, B_{2}\\right)\\right.+s_{1} E\\left(A_{2}, B_{1}\\right)+s_{1} s_{2} E\\left(A_{2}, B_{2}\\right) ] \\leq 4\n\nIf one chooses a non-factorizable function S\\left(s_{1}, s_{2}\\right), say,\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+s_{1}+s_{2}-s_{1} s_{2}\\right), the famous CHSH (Clauser, Horne,\nShimony, and Holt, 1969) inequality is recovered\n\n\\begin{aligned} S_{\\text { Bell }} & \\equiv\\left|E\\left(A_{1}, B_{1}\\right)+E\\left(A_{1}, B_{2}\\right)\\right.\\\\ &+E\\left(A_{2}, B_{1}\\right)-E\\left(A_{2}, B_{2}\\right)| \\leq 2\\end{aligned}\n\n1.4.3.6. GHZ theorem\n1.4.3.6.1. Impossibility of deriving realism via perfect quantum correlations and locality\nTake the GHZ experiment, Fig. 2. Assume that a click\nat the local detector D_{x_1} , where x = d, e, f is described as\na result of value +1, whereas clicks at D_{x_2} are ascribed\n−1. According to the quantum probabilities (20) the\naverage values of the product of local results reads\n\n\\begin{array}{c}{E\\left(\\phi_{a}, \\phi_{b}, \\phi_{c}\\right)} \\\\ {=\\sum_{i, j, k=1,2}(-1)^{i+j+k+1} p_{d_{i} e_{j} f_{k}}\\left(\\phi_{a}, \\phi_{b}, \\phi_{c}\\right)} \\\\ {=\\sin \\left(\\phi_{A}+\\phi_{B}+\\phi_{c}\\right)}\\end{array}\\tag{*}\n\n\nA^{n}(\\pi / 2) B^{n}(0) C^{n}(0)=1\n\nwhere  \nX^{n}(\\phi) \\quad(X=A, B \\text { or } C)\n s the value of a local\nmeasurement, by Alice, Bob and Cecil, respectively, that\nwould have been obtained for the n-th particle triple, if\nthe setting of the measuring device is \\phi​. \n\n\\begin{array}{l}{A^{n}(0) B^{n}(0) C^{n}(\\pi / 2)=1} \\\\ {A^{n}(0) B^{n}(\\pi / 2) C^{n}(0)=1}\\end{array}\n\nNow, in a local realistic model, from these results we\ncan deduce a further correlation by simply multiplying\nEqs. Since  \nX^{n}(0)^{2}=+1\n , regardless of whether\n X^{n}(0)=+1\n  or −1, we obtain\n\nA^{n}(\\pi / 2) B^{n}(\\pi / 2) C^{n}(\\pi / 2)=1\n\nThis, however, is in a full contradiction with the quantum\nmechanical prediction obtained from (*) which reads:\n\nA^{n}(\\pi / 2) B^{n}(\\pi / 2) C^{n}(\\pi / 2)=-1\n\nTwo-observer GHZ-like correlations\nInterestingly, the GHZ reasoning can be reduced to\na two-party (thus two space-like separated regions) case\nwhile its all-versus-nothing feature is still retained. One\noption is to encode three two-state quantum systems in\ndistinct degrees of freedom of only two photons. The second option is to find suitable EPR elements of reality\nin the two particle case, and to show that they are internally inconsistent. A third protocol of the two-observer GHZ-like the-\norem uses a two-photon hyper-entanglement.\n1.4.3.6.2. Refutation of a class of nonlocal realistic theories\nLet us discuss the description of the polarization of\nphotons within such theories. The following assumptions\nare made: (L 1 ) realism, (L 2 ) physical states are statistical mixtures of subensembles with definite polarizations,\n(L 3 ) local expectation values for polarization measurements taken for each subensemble obey Malus' law. Importantly, locality is not assumed. \nLeggett-type\ninequality\n\n\\begin{array}{l}{S_{N L H V} \\equiv\\left|E_{11}(\\varphi)+E_{23}(0)\\right|+\\left|E_{22}(\\varphi)+E_{23}(0)\\right|} \\\\ { \\leq 4-\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\left|\\sin \\frac{\\varphi}{2}\\right|}\\end{array}\n\nwhere  \nE_{k l}(\\varphi)\n  is a uniform average of all correlation functions, defined in the plane of  \n\\mathbf{a}_{k}\n  and  \n\\mathbf{b}_{l}\n  , with the same\nrelative angle \\varphi . Inequalities avoiding the averaging were\nalso derived and tested. For the inequality to be applicable, the vectors\n \\mathbf{a}_{1}\n  and  \\mathbf{b}_{1}\n  necessarily have to lie in a plane orthogonal\nto the one defined by  \n\\mathbf{a}_{2}\n  and  \n\\mathbf{b}_{2}\n  . This contrasts with the\nCHSH inequality.\n1.4.3.7. QUANTUM COMMUNICATION\nQuantum communication ultimately aims at absolute\nsecurity and faithful transfer of information, classical or\nquantum.\n1.4.3.7.1. Quantum dense coding\nThe idea of quantum dense coding  is that, by manipulating\nonly one of the two particles in a Bell state, one can also\nencode two bits of information.\nThe procedure runs as follows:\nStep 1. Sharing maximal entanglement. A maximally\nentangled qubit pair (say, in the state  \n| \\psi^{+} \\rangle_{A B}\n  ) is shared\nby Alice and Bob (Fig. 31). They agree in advance\nthat  \n| \\psi^{-} \\rangle_{A B}, \\phi^{-} \\rangle_{A B}, \\phi^{+} \\rangle_{A B}, \\text { and } | \\psi^{+} \\rangle_{A B}\n  respectively\nrepresent the binary numbers 00, 01, 10, and 11.\nStep 2. Coding of the message. According to the value\nBob wants to transmit to Alice, he performs one out of\nfour possible unitary transformations (identity operation\n \\hat{I}, \\sigma_{x}, \\sigma_{y}, \\text { and } \\sigma_{z}\n ) on his qubit B alone. The three non-\nI,\nidentity operations transform, in an one-to-one way, the\noriginal state  \n| \\psi^{+} \\rangle_{A B}\n  , respectively, into  \n| \\phi^{+} \\rangle_{A B}, \\phi^{-} \\rangle_{A B}\n  ,\nand  \n| \\psi^{-} \\rangle_{A B}\n  . Once this is done, Bob sends his qubit to\nAlice. Note that this possibility of transforming any of\nthe four basis states to any other by only manipulating\none of the two qubits holds only for the maximally entangled states. For product (and classical) states it is\nalways necessary to have control over both qubits (bits)\nto encode two bits in four distinguishable states.\nStep 3. Decoding of the message. Upon reception, Alice performs a Bell-state measurement, distinguishing between the four code-states and thus allowing her to read\nout both bits of information. The quantum dense coding doubles the information capacity of the transmission\nchannel: what is actually sent is only one qubit. This\nmore efficient way of coding information at first glance\nseems to be at odds with the Holevo theorem (1973),\nwhich states that maximally one bit can be encoded on a\nsingle qubit. Entanglement, a property of pairs of qubits,\nallows to circumvent this theorem and to encode infor-\nmation entirely in the relative properties of the pair, i.e.\nin their correlations.\n1.4.3.7.2. Quantum teleportation\nTheory: qubit teleportation involving an EPR channel and two bit transfer\nsee this and this\nOpen-destination quantum teleportation\nThe so-called\nopen-destination teleportation is a protocol allowing to transfer a state to\none of several potential recipients. It can be decided who\ngets the state even after the initial to-be-teleported state,\n | x \\rangle\n , is wiped out in a Bell-state measurement.\nFigure 24 shows the basic scheme. One uses a quantum\nchannel in form of a N +1 qubit GHZ state, say for N = 3\nand for polarization qubits:\n\n| \\Phi \\rangle_{2345}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}( |H\\rangle_{2} | H \\rangle_{3} | H \\rangle_{4} | H \\rangle_{5}+| V \\rangle_{2} | V \\rangle_{3} | V \\rangle_{4} | V \\rangle_{5} )\n\nand requires, as always, a transfer of two bit classical information. The polarization state to-be-teleported\n | \\chi \\rangle_{1}=\\alpha | H \\rangle_{1}+\\beta | V \\rangle_{1}\n  is first encoded into an N -particle\ncoherent superposition of these GHZ particles. By making a Bell state measurement on, say, photons 1 and\n2, one projects the remaining photons into one of four\nstates. E.g. whenever the result of the Bell-state measurement is a  \n\\psi^{+}\n  state, one gets\n\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\beta | H\\rangle_{3} | H \\rangle_{4} | H \\rangle_{5}+\\alpha | V \\rangle_{3} | V \\rangle_{4} | V \\rangle_{5} )\n\nThe state  \n| \\chi \\rangle\n  can be read out at any of the three par-\nticles, by performing a suitable projection measurement\non N − 1 of them, here on 2, and a unitary transformation dependent of the received two bits of data, which is carried out on one of the GHZ particles.  Assume\nthat we want to transfer our state to particle 5. To this\nend upon the receipt of information concerning the result\nof the BSM, the partner 5 must perform on his particle\na  \n\\sigma_{x}\n  transformation which interchanges polarizations H\nand V . The partners\n 3 and 4 make measurements in the\n | \\pm \\rangle=( |H\\rangle \\pm | V \\rangle ) / \\sqrt{2}\n  basis. The recipient of the state\nis informed about the measurement results . Once the\nrecipient gets this additional information, only if there\nwas just one result associated with a projection to  \n|-\\rangle\n ,\nhe/she performs the sign flipping \\sigma_z​ transformation. The\nstate is recovered.\n1.4.3.7.3. Entanglement swapping\nTheory\nEntanglement swapping, together with entanglement purification, is a key element of the quantum repeater protocol and opens\na way to efficiently distribute entanglement for massive\nparticles. \n\n\\begin{array}{c}{\\Psi \\rangle_{1234}=\\frac{1}{2}( |\\psi^{+}\\rangle_{14} | \\psi^{+} \\rangle_{23}-| \\psi^{-} \\rangle_{14} | \\psi^{-} \\rangle_{23}} \\\\ {-| \\phi^{+} \\rangle_{14} | \\phi^{+} \\rangle_{23}+| \\phi^{-} \\rangle_{14} | \\phi^{-} \\rangle_{23}}\\end{array}\n\nNamely, as soon as Al-\nice completes the Bell-state measurement on particles 2\nand 3, we know that photons 1 and 4 are on their way,\nready for detection in an entangled state. In this way\none has the possibility to perform an event-ready test of\nBell’s inequality\nHalder et al. (2007) took a different approach to achieve entanglement swapping by a\nprecise time measurement. The photon detector used in\nthe experiment was a niobium nitride superconducting\nsingle photon detector with a time resolution of 74ps .\nThe photons were filtered using 10pm-bandwidth filters,\nwhich corresponds to a coherence time of 350ps well\nabove the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence,\nultra-coincidence photon timing could be obtained, and\npulsed sources could be replaced by continuous-wave\nsources, which do not require any synchronization.\n1.4.3.7.4. Beating noisy environment\nAn important tool to overcome the noise in the quan-\ntum communication channel is entanglement distillation,\nconcentration and purification\nEntanglement distillation and concentration\nEntanglement concentration aims to obtain with a\nnonzero probability a higher entanglement from pure\nstates with a lower entanglement. There are two methods to achieve this. The first is the so-called Procrustean\nmethod. It requires that the photon pairs are all in a pure non-maximally entangled state,\nsay,  \n| \\Psi \\rangle_{\\text { nonmax }}=\\alpha | H \\rangle | V \\rangle+\\beta | V \\rangle | H \\rangle\n , where \\alpha and \\beta are\ntwo known amplitudes. In this case, the scheme only involves local filtering operations on single pairs. Second, the Schmidt decomposition scheme works for photon\npairs that are all in a pure but unknown non-maximally\nentangled state  \n| \\Psi \\rangle_{\\text { nonmax }}\n  . In practice, this scheme is\nmore difficult to implement as it requires simultaneous\ncollective measurements on many photons.\nEntanglement purification\nThe underlying idea of entanglement purification is\nthat, by using local operations and classical commu-\nnication (LOCC) only, to extract from multiple copies\nof imperfect states (arbitrary mixed states) fewer copies\nof entangled state asymptotically to near-unity fidelity.\nThe linear-optical purification scheme [shown in Fig.\n28(b)] will be presented here using a specific example.\nLet our initial state be\n\n\\rho_{a b}=F | \\phi^{+} \\rangle_{a b}\\left\\langle\\phi^{+}|+(1-F)| \\psi^{-}\\right\\rangle_{a b}\\left\\langle\\psi^{-}|\\right.\n\nwhere  \n| \\psi^{-} \\rangle_{a b}\n  is an unwanted admixture. The subscripts\na and b indicate the particles at Alice's and Bob's locations, respectively.\nAlice and Bob share a big number of pairs described\nby  \n\\rho_{a b}\n  . They start by picking at random two such pairs.\nEach of them superimposes their photons on a PBS. An\nessential step in the purification scheme is to select those\ncases for which there is exactly one photon in each of\nthe four spatial output modes. We shall refer to them\nas “four-mode cases”. This corresponds to a projection\nonto the subspace in which two photons at the same experimental location (Alice’s or Bob’s) have equal polarization. This is similar to the bilateral CNOT-operation\nof the original scheme. Note that the polarizations at\ntwo different locations do not have to be the same. After\nperforming the purification procedure (selection of four-\nmode cases, measurements in modes a4 and b4 in the\n+/− basis, and local operations conditional on the mea-\nsurement results), Alice and Bob will finally create a new\nensemble described by the density operator\n\n\\rho_{a b}^{\\prime}=F^{\\prime} | \\phi^{+} \\rangle_{a b}\\left\\langle\\phi^{+}\\left|+\\left(1-F^{\\prime}\\right)\\right| \\psi^{-}\\right\\rangle_{a b}\\left\\langle\\psi^{-}|\\right.\n\nwith a larger fidelity  \nF^{\\prime}=F^{2} /\\left[F^{2}+(1-F)^{2}\\right]\n  ] (for\n F>1 / 2\n ) of pairs in the desired state than before thepurification.\nThough it seems that only a rather special example, single bit-flip error, has been considered, the same\nmethod actually applies to the arbitrary mixed states\nρ ab , provided that they contain a sufficiently large fraction F > 1/2 of photon pairs in a maximally entangled state. This works as follows: one can first purify\naway single bit-flip errors; phase errors can then be easily transformed into bit-flip errors by a  45^{\\circ}  polarization\nrotation and treated in a subsequent purification step. \n\n1.4.3.7.5. Quantum memory and quantum repeaters\nThe quantum repeater protocol provides a\nblueprint of a general framework to remedy this problem by nesting entanglement purification and swapping\nsteps. Once constructed it would enable one to establish\nhigh-quality long-distance entanglement with resources\nincreasing only polynomially with transmission distance.\nQuantum repeater protocol\nThe quantum repeater protocol comprises three elements:\n\nA method for creation of entanglement between\nparticles at distant nodes, which uses auxiliary particles at intermediate “connection points” and a\nnested purification protocol.\nEntanglement purification, even with imperfect\n means.\nA protocol for which the time needed for entanglement creation scales polynomially, whereas the\n required material resources per connection point\n grow only logarithmically with the distance.\n\n\nFigure 32 is a schematic of a setup for entangling two\natomic ensembles (optically-thick atomic cells of N_\\alpha identical atoms) L and R which are spatially separated within\nthe channel attenuation length. A pair of metastable\nlower states |g\\rangle and |s\\rangle  can correspond to hyperfine or\nZeeman sublevels of electronic ground states of alkali\natoms.\nAll the atoms are initially prepared in the ground\nstates  \n| g \\rangle_{i}\n  . A sample is illuminated by a short, off-\nresonant laser pulse that induces Raman transitions\ninto states  \n| s \\rangle_{i}\n  . Particularly important is the forward-scattered Stokes light (the signal mode  \n\\hat{a}\n ). It is uniquely correlated with the excitation\nthe symmetric collective atomic mode \\hat{S} \\equiv\\left(1 / \\sqrt{N_{a}}\\right) \\sum_{i} | g \\rangle_{i i}\\langle s|\n, where the\nsummation is taken over all the atoms.

If  \nt_\\Delta\n  is very small, the two-mode squeezed\nstate can be written in the perturbative form\n\n| \\zeta \\rangle=| 0_{a} \\rangle | 0_{p} \\rangle+\\sqrt{p_{c}} \\hat{S}^{\\dagger} \\hat{a}^{\\dagger} | 0_{a} \\rangle | 0_{p} \\rangle+O\\left(p_{c}\\right)\\tag{*}\n\nwhere  \np_{c}=\\tanh ^{2} r_{c} \\ll 1\n  is the small excitation probability and  \nO\\left(p_{c}\\right)\n  represents the terms with more excitations,\nwhose probabilities are equal or smaller than  \np_{c}^{2}\n  .

Let\nus summarize the basic ideas behind it. The atomic ensemble generates a correlated state in Eq(*) , which is\nan exact analog of the SPDC radiation. By measuring\nthe forward signal mode with a single-photon detector,\nunder the condition that the detector clicks, the collective atomic mode is projected to a single-excitation state.\nSuch excitations can be stored for a reasonably long time\nin metastable states (the so-called ground-state manifold) of the atoms. On demand the single-atomic excitation can be transferred to a single photon (still within the\nstorage time) with a method described in the next section. This is with fully controllable properties: the emitted single-photon pulse is directed forward; the emission\ntime is controllable by the repumping time; and the pulse\nshape is controllable by varying the time dependence of\nthe Rabi frequency of the repumping pulse.\nQuantum state transfer between matter and photons\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)Multi Photon Entanglement And Interferometry\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"3-Boson sampling/Time-Bin-Encoded Boson Sampling with a Single-Photon Device.html":{"url":"3-Boson sampling/Time-Bin-Encoded Boson Sampling with a Single-Photon Device.html","title":"Time Bin Encoded Boson Sampling With A Single Photon Device","keywords":"","body":"1.4.4.

Photon source\nAn intrinsic problem in the SPDC, however,is that the photon pairs are generated probabilistically,\nand mixed with double pair emission. To scale up to a larger number of photons and fast sampling rate, a more efficient route is to use single-photon sources that emit one and only one photon each time. Here is quantum dot(QD) micropillar.\n1.4.4.2. Scheme\n \n\nFor each experimental period, M time bins(each loaded with one or zero photon) are injected into a loop by an acousto-optical modulator (AOM) and circulated for N loops. Such a loop-based architecture is equivalent to an M-mode beam splitter network with a depth of N, as illustrated in Fig(b). Here, the polarization degree of freedom acts as the spatial mode in the conventional boson sampling model. The beam splitter operations, denoted by the circles in Fig(b), are effectively realized using a polarization-rotation electro-optic modulator (p-EOM) with dynamically programmable coupling ratio. After the p-EOM, a polarization-dependent asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer delays the vertical polarization for one time-bin length (∼13 ns), regarding to the horizontal polarization, which realizes the displacement operation of the time bins. After N loops of evolution, the M bins are ejected out of the loop by another AOM, and the output distributions are obtained by registering all of the single-photon detectionevents in real time and postprocessing . We calibrate the mode matching of the time-bin loop using Mach-Zehnder interference. The time-bin encoding scheme naturally complements the single-photon pulse train.\n1.4.4.3. Strength\nThe loop-based architecture is intrinsically stable, electrically programmable, and resource efficient. For an arbitrary n-boson sampling, this scheme requires only one single-photon emitter, two optical switches, two EOMs, and two fast detectors, whereas the traditional spatial-encoding approach requires n-1 optical switches,  \\sim n^4   beam splitters, and \\sim n^2detectors.  Furthermore, it relaxes the overhead of actively demultiplexing a single-photon source or building an array of multiple identical single-photon sources\n1.4.4.4. limitation\nThe overall efficiency of the current experiment is\nmainly limited by the system efficiency of the single-\nphoton source (∼24.7%, due to losses in light extraction,cross polarization, optical path transmission, and fiber coupling), transmission of the loop-based interferometer(∼83.4% per loop), and single-photon detection efficiency(∼52%).\n1.4.4.5. Error\nThe slight fidelity decrease might be mainly due to the mode mismatching (0.5%) per loop\n1.4.4.6.

However, usually the uncontrolled entanglement in the frequency and/or time\ncan significantly degrade the entanglement in the polarization.\nFurther, beam-like SPDC  was\ndeveloped with the photon pairs in the form of two separate Gaussian-like beams, which\nhad higher brightness and efficiency coupling into a single spatial mode than\nthose from the non-collinear SPDC where the collection was at intersections of the two\ndown-converted photon rings.\nGenerally, due to conservation of momentum in SPDC, a lower momentum\nuncertainty of pump beam can lead to a higher collection efficiency.

Experimental quantum teleportation [17]\n1.5.3.1. Abstract\nQuantum teleportation—the transmission and reconstruction over arbitrary distances of the state of a quantum\nsystem—is demonstrated experimentally. During teleportation, an initial photon which carries the polarization that is to\nbe transferred and one of a pair of entangled photons are subjected to a measurement such that the second photon of\nthe entangled pair acquires the polarization of the initial photon. This latter photon can be arbitrarily far away from the\ninitial one. Quantum teleportation will be a critical ingredient for quantum computation networks.\nHere we report the first experimental verification of quantum\nteleportation. By producing pairs of entangled photons by the\nprocess of parametric down-conversion and using two-photon\ninterferometry for analysing entanglement, we could transfer a\nquantum property (in our case the polarization state) from one\nphoton to another. The methods developed for this experiment will\nbe of great importance both for exploring the field of quantum\ncommunication and for future experiments on the foundations of\nquantum mechanics.\n1.5.3.2.

The concept of quantum teleportation\nThe teleportation scheme works as follows. Alice has the particle 1\nin the initial state | \\psi \\rangle_1 and particle 2. Particle 2 is entangled with\nparticle 3 in the hands of Bob. The essential point is to perform a\nspecific measurement on particles 1 and 2 which projects them onto\nthe entangled state:\n\n|\\psi^- \\rangle_{12}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\leftrightarrow \\rangle_1|\\updownarrow \\rangle_2 - |\\updownarrow \\rangle_1|\\leftrightarrow \\rangle_2)\n\nQuantum physics predicts 1 that once particles 1 and 2 are\nprojected into |\\psi^- \\rangle_{12} , particle 3 is instantaneously projected into\nthe initial state of particle 1.\n(I think the explantion is concise)\nThe reason for this is as follows. Because\nwe observe particles 1 and 2 in the state |\\psi^- \\rangle_{12} we know that whatever\nthe state of particle 1 is, particle 2 must be in the opposite state, that\nis, in the state orthogonal to the state of particle 1. But we had\ninitially prepared particle 2 and 3 in the state |\\psi^- \\rangle_{23} , which means\nthat particle 2 is also orthogonal to particle 3. This is only possible if\nparticle 3 is in the same state as particle 1 was initially. The final state\nof particle 3 is therefore:\n\n| \\psi \\rangle_3= \\alpha|\\leftrightarrow \\rangle_3 +\\beta |\\updownarrow \\rangle_3\n\nIt is also important to notice that the Bell-state measurement does\nnot reveal any information on the properties of any of the particles.\n \nFigure 1  Scheme showing principles involved in quantum teleportation (a) and\nthe experimental set-up (b) . a, Alice has a quantum system, particle 1, in an initial\nstate which she wants to teleport to Bob. Alice and Bob also share an ancillary\nentangled pair of particles 2 and 3 emitted by an Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR)\nsource. Alice then performs a joint Bell-state measurement (BSM) on the initial\nparticle and one of the ancillaries, projecting them also onto an entangled state.\nAfter she has sent the result of her measurement as classical information to Bob,\nhe can perform a unitary transformation (U) on the other ancillary particle resulting\nin it being in the state of the original particle. b, A pulse of ultraviolet radiation\npassing through a nonlinear crystal creates the ancillary pair of photons 2 and 3.\nAfter retroflection during its second passage through the crystal the ultraviolet\npulse creates another pair of photons, one of which will be prepared in the initial\nstate of photon 1 to be teleported, the other one serving as a trigger indicating that\na photon to be teleported is under way. Alice then looks for coincidences after a\nbeam splitter BS where the initial photon and one of the ancillaries are\nsuperposed. Bob, after receiving the classical information that Alice obtained a\ncoincidence count in detectors f1 and f2 identifying the |w − i 12 Bell state, knows that\nhis photon 3 is in the initial state of photon 1 which he then can check using\npolarization analysis with the polarizing beam splitter PBS and the detectors d1\nand d2. The detector p provides the information that photon 1 is under way. \n1.5.3.4. Experimental realization\nWe produced the entangled photons 2 and 3 by parametric downconversion.\nTo achieve projection of photons 1 and 2 into a Bell state we have\nto make them indistinguishable. To achieve this indistinguishability\nwe superpose the two photons at a beam splitter (Fig. 1b).\nTo make sure that photons 1 and 2 cannot be distinguished by\ntheir arrival times, they were generated using a pulsed pump beam\nand sent through narrow-bandwidth filters producing a coherence\ntime much longer than the pump pulse length.\nHow can one experimentally prove that an unknown quantum\nstate can be teleported? First, one has to show that teleportation\nworks for a (complete) basis, a set of known states into which any\nother state can be decomposed.\nSecond, one has to show that teleportation\nworks for superpositions of these base states.\n\nFigure 2 Photons emerging from type II down-conversion (see text).

Observation of Three-Photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger Entanglement [18]\nWe present the experimental observation of polarization entanglement for three spatially separated\nphotons. Such states of more than two entangled particles, known as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\n(GHZ) states, play a crucial role in fundamental tests of quantum mechanics versus local realism and\nin many quantum information and quantum computation schemes. Our experimental arrangement is\nsuch that we start with two pairs of entangled photons and register the photons in a way that any\ninformation as to which pair each photon belongs to is erased. After detecting a trigger photon, the\nregistered events at the detectors for the remaining three photons exhibit the desired GHZ correlations.\nThe main idea is to\ntransform two pairs of polarization entangled photons into\nthree entangled photons and a fourth independent photon. In our experiment the GHZ entanglement is observed\nonly under the condition that both the trigger photon and\nthe three entangled photons are actually detected. Thus,\ndetection plays the double role of both projecting into the\nGHZ state and performing a specific measurement on the\nstate.\n\nFIG. 1.

Nevertheless, it is still an open question how well\none can copy quantum states, i.e., when ideal copies are not\navailable how close the copy state (out state in the mode b)\ncan be to the original state (i.e., |s \\rangle_a ). The other question to\nanswer is what happens to the original state |s \\rangle_a after the\ncopying.\nWith the advent of\nquantum communication, e.g., quantum cryptography, and\nquantum computing, understanding the limits of the manipu-\nlations we can perform on quantum information becomes\nimportant.\n1.5.5.2. WOOTTERS-ZUREK QUANTUM-COPYING MACHINE AND NONCLONING THEOREM\nIn their paper Wootters and Zurek analyzed the copying process defined by the transformation relation on basis\nvectors |0\\rangle_a and |1\\rangle_a :\n\n|0\\rangle_a|Q\\rangle_x\\rightarrow|0\\rangle_a|0\\rangle_b|Q_0\\rangle_x\n\n\n|1\\rangle_a|Q\\rangle_x\\rightarrow|1\\rangle_a|1\\rangle_b|Q_1\\rangle_x\n\nwe can assume\nthat\n\n\\sideset{_x}{_x} {\\langle Q|Q\\rangle}=\\sideset{_x}{_x} {\\langle Q_0|Q_0\\rangle}=\\sideset{_x}{_x} {\\langle Q_1|Q_1\\rangle}=1\n\nThe Wootters-Zurek (WZ) quantum-copying machine\n(QCM) is defined in such a way that the basis vectors |0\\rangle_a\nand |1\\rangle_a are copied (that is, cloned) ideally, that is, for these\nstates the relation (1.1) is fulfilled.\nThe Hilbert-Schmidt norm of an operator Â is given by\n\n\\|\\hat{A}\\|_2=[\\text{Tr}(\\hat{A}^\\dagger\\hat{A})]^{1/2}\n\nOur distance between the density matrices \\hat{\\rho}_1 and \\hat{\\rho}_2 is then\n\nD=(\\|\\hat{\\rho}_1-\\hat{\\rho}_2\\|_2)^2\n\nOther measures of the similarity of two density matrices\nhave been used. Schumacher  has advocated the use of\nfidelity which is defined as\n\nF=\\text{Tr}(\\hat{\\rho}_1^{1/2}\\hat{\\rho}_2\\hat{\\rho}_1^{1/2})^{1/2}\\tag{2.1}\n\n1.5.5.3. INPUT-STATE-INDEPENDENT QUANTUM-COPYING MACHINE\nWhen using this 'universal'\nquantum-copying machine (UQCM) superposition states\n\n|s\\rangle_a=\\alpha|0\\rangle_a+\\beta|1\\rangle_a\n\n are copied equally well for any value of a in the sense\n2\nthat the distances D_a=\\text{Tr}[\\hat{\\rho}_a^{(out)}-\\hat{\\rho}_a^{(id)}]^2\nand D_{ab}=\\text{Tr}[\\hat{\\rho}_{ab}^{(out)}-\\hat{\\rho}_{ab}^{(id)}]^2 do not depend on the parameter \\alpha.\nThe most general quantum-copying transformation rules\nfor pure states on a two-dimensional space can be written as\n\n|0 \\rangle_a|Q \\rangle_x\\rightarrow\\sum^1_{k,l=0}|k \\rangle_a|l \\rangle_b|Q_{kl} \\rangle_x,\n\n\n|1 \\rangle_a|Q \\rangle_x\\rightarrow\\sum^1_{m,n=0}|m \\rangle_a|n \\rangle_b|Q_{mn} \\rangle_x,\n\nwhere the states |Q_{mn} \\rangle_x are not necessarily orthonormal for all possible values of m and n. The general copying transformation is very complex and it involves many free parameters \\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Q_{kl}|Q_{mn}\\rangle } which characterize the copying machine.\nIn what follows we will concentrate our attention on one\nparticular copying transformation which fulfills our demands\nas described above. We propose the transformation\n\n|0 \\rangle_a|Q \\rangle_x\\rightarrow|0 \\rangle_a|0 \\rangle_b|Q_0 \\rangle_x+[|0 \\rangle_a|1 \\rangle_b+|1 \\rangle_a|0 \\rangle_b]|Y_0 \\rangle_x\n\n\n|1 \\rangle_a|Q \\rangle_x\\rightarrow|1 \\rangle_a|1 \\rangle_b|Q_1 \\rangle_x+[|0 \\rangle_a|1 \\rangle_b+|1 \\rangle_a|0 \\rangle_b]|Y_1 \\rangle_x\n\nwhich is an obvious generalization of the WZ QCM. Due to\nthe unitarity of the transformation (3.2) the following relations hold:\n\n\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Q_i|Q_i \\rangle}+2\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Y_i|Y_i \\rangle}=1,\\quad i=0,1\n\n\n\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Y_0|Y_1 \\rangle}=\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Y_1|Y_0 \\rangle}=0\n\nThere are still many free parameters to specify, therefore we\nwill further assume that the copying-machine state vectors\n|Y_i \\rangle_x and |Q_i \\rangle_x are mutually orthogonal:\n\n\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Q_i|Y_i \\rangle}=0, \\quad i=0,1\n\nand that\n\n\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Q_0|Q_1 \\rangle}=0\n\nThe Hilbert-Schmidt norm\n\nD_a=2 \\xi^2(4 \\alpha^4-4 \\alpha^2+1)+2 \\alpha^2(1- \\alpha^2)(\\eta-1)^2\n\nwhere we have introduced the notation\n\n\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Y_0|Y_0 \\rangle}=\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Y_1|Y_1 \\rangle}=\\xi\n\n\n\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Y_0|Q_1 \\rangle}=\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Q_0|Y_1 \\rangle}=\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Q_1|Y_0 \\rangle}=\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Y_1|Q_0 \\rangle}=\\eta/2\n\nWe find that if the parameters j and h are related as\n\n\\eta=1-2 \\xi\n\nthen the norm D a is input-state independent and it takes the\nvalue\n\nD_a=2 \\xi^2\n\n\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha^2}D_{ab}^{(2)}=0\n\nwe find  \\xi =1/6. For this value of \\xi  the norm D_{ab}is \\alphaindependent and its value is equal to 2/9.\n1.5.5.3.1. Some properties of the UQCM\n\nAny measurement performed on mode b affects the\nstate of mode a.\nOnce we have found the basis in which both density operators \\hat{\\rho}^{(id)}\nand \\hat{\\rho}^{(out)}\nare diagonal we can easily find the\nvalue of the fidelity parameter F a as introduced by Schumacher. The fidelity parameter which we are interested in is\ngiven by Eq.(2.1) with \\hat{\\rho}_1=\\hat{\\rho}_a^{(id)} and \\hat{\\rho}_2=\\hat{\\rho}_a^{(out)}\nIn our case the fidelity is equal to a constant value \\sqrt{5/6} for all input\nstates. We can conclude that the UQCM has that universal\nproperty to be input-state independent, that is, all pure states\nare copied equally well.\n\n1.5.5.4. MEASUREMENT OF THE ORIGINAL AND THE COPY STATE AT THE OUTPUT OF QCM\nIn summary the output from the UQCM has the following\nproperty. If any projection is measured in the b mode the\nunconditioned a-mode ensemble which results is close to the\nideal output state, i.e., the input state, and can be used to find\nthe expectation value of any a-mode operator in the ideal\noutput state. In addition, the b-mode measurement provides\nus with information about the input state.\n1.5.5.5. COPYING STATES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF GIVEN STATE\nWhat we can do\nwith the output of this copying machine is to use it to calcu-\nlate the expectation values of any operator which annihilates\nthis state.\n1.5.5.6. CONCLUSIONS\nA problem with all of these machines is that the copy and\noriginal which appear at the output are entangled. This\nmeans that a measurement of one affects the other. We\nfound, however, that a nonselective measurement of one of\nthe output modes will provide information about the input\nstate and not disturb the reduced density matrix of the other\nmode. Therefore the output of these copying machines is\nuseful.\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)Quantum Copying Beyond The No Cloning Theorem\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"4-Quantum manipulation/Teleporting an unknown quantum state via dual classical and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen channels.html":{"url":"4-Quantum manipulation/Teleporting an unknown quantum state via dual classical and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen channels.html","title":"Teleporting An Unknown Quantum State Via Dual Classical And Einstein Podolsky Rosen Channels","keywords":"","body":"1.5.6.

We characterize the set of states\naccessible from an initial EPR state by one-particle operations and show that in a sense they allow two\nbits to be encoded reliably in one spin-\\frac{1}{2} particle: One party, “Alice,” prepares an EPR pair and sends\none of the particles to another party, “Bob,” who applies one of four unitary operators to the particle,\nand then returns it to Alice.

(3) and then returns the treated\nparticle to Alice. Now possessing both particles, Alice\ncan in principle measure them jointly in the orthonormal\nbasis of Eq. (3), and so reliably learn which operator\nBob applied.\nFrom one viewpoint, this is surprising, because Bob has\ncommunicated a two-bit message by unitarily operating\non a single spin-\\frac{1}{2} particle. Thinking too classically, one\nmight be tempted to say that his manipulations have\ntherefore placed the treated particle into four reliably distinguishable states, contradicting a basic principle of\nquantum mechanics that such a particle can have only\ntwo reliably distinguishable states. But the scheme also\ndepends on the untreated particle. It therefore might be\nbetter to say, as Schumacher suggests, that one of the\ntwo bits is sent forward in time through the treated particle, while the other bit is sent backward in time to the\nEPR source, then forward in time through the untreated\nparticle, until finally it is combined with the bit in the\ntreated particle to reconstitute the two-bit message. Because the bit “sent backward in time” cannot be used to\ntransmit a meaningful message without the help of the\nother particle, no opportunity for time travel or superluminal communication is created, just as none is created\nin the classic EPR experiment in which simultaneous\nmeasurements are used to establish non-message-bearing\ncorrelations over a spacelike interval.\nThe EPR scheme has the advantage of allowing some of\nthe particle transmissions to take place before the message has been decided upon, perhaps at cheaper “off-peak” rates.\n\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)Communication Via One And Two Particle Operators On Einstein Podolsky Rosen States\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"6-Quantum communication/Quantum Cryptography Using Any Two Nonorthogonal States.html":{"url":"6-Quantum communication/Quantum Cryptography Using Any Two Nonorthogonal States.html","title":"Quantum Cryptography Using Any Two Nonorthogonal States","keywords":"","body":"1.7.2. Quantum Cryptography Using Any Two Nonorthogonal States[22]1.7.2. Quantum Cryptography Using Any Two Nonorthogonal States[22]\nHere we show that in principle any two nonorthogonal quantum states\nsuffice, and describe a practical interferometric realization using low-intensity coherent light pulses.\nTwo of the main\ngoals of cryptography: encrypting a subsequent meaningful message to make it unintelligible to a third party,\nand certifying to the legitimate receiver that a message\n(plain or encrypted) has not been altered in transit.\nThe security of non-EPR key distribution\nschemes is derived from the fact that any measurement\nwhich fails to disturb each of two nonorthogonal states\nalso fails to yield any information distinguishing them.\nLet |u_0\\rangle​and  |u_1\\rangle​ be two distinct, nonorthogonal states,\nand let P_0=1-|u_1\\rangle\\langle u_1|​ and P_1=1-|u_0\\rangle\\langle u_0|​ be (noncommuting) projection operators onto subspaces orthogonal to |u_0\\rangle​ and  |u_1\\rangle​, respectively (note reversed order of\nindices). Thus P_0​ annihilates |u_1​, but yields a positive\nresult with probability\n1-|\\langle u_0| u_1\\rangle|^2​ when applied to\n|u_0\\rangle​, and vice versa for P_1​ \nTo begin the key distribution, Alice prepares and sends\nBob a random binary sequence of quantum systems, using\nstates |u_0\\rangle​ and |u_1\\rangle​ to represent the bits 0 and 1, respectively. Bob then decides, randomly and independently of\nAlice for each system, whether to subject it to a measurement of  P_0​ or P_1​. Next Bob publicly tells Alice in which\ninstances his measurement had a positive result (but not,of course, which measurement he made), and the two\nparties agree to discard all the other instances.\nIf there has been no eavesdropping, the remaining instances, a fraction approximately (1-|\\langle u_0| u_1\\rangle|^2)/2 of\nthe original trials, should be perfectly correlated, consisting entirely of instances in which Alice sent |u_0\\rangle and Bob\nmeasured P_0, or Alice sent |u_1\\rangle and Bob measured P_1.\nHowever, before Alice and Bob can trust this data as key,\nthey must, as in other key distribution schemes, sacrifice\nsome of it to verify that their versions of the key are\nindeed identical. This also certifies the absence of eavesdropping, which would necessarily have disturbed the\nstates |u_0\\rangle or|u_1\\rangle in transit, causing them sometimes to\nyield positive results when later subjected to measurements P_1 or P_0​ , respectively.\n\nThis third pulse contains no phase information, but serves to confirm that the reference pulse has actually arrived. It thus protects against an attack in which\nan eavesdropper (“Eve”) would measure each signal-\nreference pulse pair by an apparatus similar to Bob's,\nresend a correctly fabricated pulse pair whenever she was\nsuccessful, and suppress both the signal and reference\npulses when she was unsuccessful, thereby eavesdropping\non the channel without creating errors in Bob's subsequent measurement results. Eve cannot suppress the\nreference pulse without immediately being caught. But if\nshe suppresses only the signal pulse, the uncancelled reference pulse will still produce a count in Bob's detector\nwith probability ,\\mu Tq, and half these counts will result in\nerrors in Bob's key.\nSince any pair of coherent or incoherent optical signals\nbecome significantly nonorthogonal at low intensity, it\nwould seem that almost any source of two kinds of dim\nlight flash could be used for key distribution\nwithout the complications of interferometry. However,\na more intrusive Eve, who stands between Alice and Bob,\ncan thoroughly subvert the scheme by intercepting all AIice’s flashes, and resending a flash to Bob\nonly when she succeeds in seeing Alice’s flash herself,\nwhile simply stopping the others. By contrast, in the interferometric scheme of Fig. 2, there is no fake signal an\neavesdropper can substitute to hide her failure to detect\nthe original signal, and the scheme remains secure.\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)Quantum Cryptography Using Any Two Nonorthogonal States\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"6-Quantum communication/Quantum secret sharing.html":{"url":"6-Quantum communication/Quantum secret sharing.html","title":"Quantum Secret Sharing","keywords":"","body":"1.7.3.

Quantum secret sharing [23]\nSecret sharing is a procedure for splitting a message into several parts so that no subset of parts is sufficient\nto read the message, but the entire set is. We show how this procedure can be implemented using Greenberger-\nHorne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. In the quantum case the presence of an eavesdropper will introduce errors so\nthat his presence can be detected. We also show how GHZ states can be used to split quantum information into\ntwo parts so that both parts are necessary to reconstruct the original qubit.\n1.7.3.1. INTRODUCTION\nSecret sharing can be used, for example, to guarantee that no single person can open a vault, has access to an\nindustrial secret, or can launch a missile with a nuclear warhead, but two together can. This means that for security to be\nbreached, two people must act in concert, thereby making it\nmore difficult for any single person who wants to gain illegal\naccess to the secret information; he must convince the other\nparty to go along and he risks discovery in the process.\nFrom Alice's original message, she creates two coded messages, one of which\nis sent to Bob and the other to Charlie. Each of the encrypted\nmessages contains no information about her original message, but together they contain the complete message.\n(XOR can do this)\nWe would like to show that it is possible to combine\nquantum cryptography with secret sharing in a way that will\nallow one to determine whether an eavesdropper has been\nactive during the secret sharing protocol.\nThe method for splitting a message into two parts that we\npresent here uses maximally entangled three-particle states,\nor Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states.\n1.7.3.2. GHZ STATES AND SECRET SHARING\nLet us suppose that Alice, Bob, and Charlie each have one\nparticle from a GHZ triplet that is in the state\n\n|\\Psi \\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|000 \\rangle+|111 \\rangle)\n\nThey each choose at random whether to measure their particle in the x or y direction. They then announce publicly in\nwhich direction they have made a measurement, but not the\nresults of their measurements. Half the time, Bob and Charlie, by combining the results of their measurements, can determine what the result of Alice’s measurement was. This\nallows Alice to establish a joint key with Bob and Charlie,\nwhich she can then use to send her message.\n\n|+x \\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0 \\rangle+|1 \\rangle), \\quad|+y \\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0 \\rangle+i|1 \\rangle),\n\n\n|-x \\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0 \\rangle-|1 \\rangle), \\quad|-y \\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0 \\rangle-i|1 \\rangle).\n\n\n|0 \\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+x \\rangle+|-x \\rangle), \\quad |1 \\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+x \\rangle-|-x \\rangle),\n\n\n|\\Psi \\rangle=\\frac{1}{2}[(|+x \\rangle_a|+x \\rangle_b+|-x \\rangle_a|-x \\rangle_b)|+x \\rangle_c+(|+x \\rangle_a|-x \\rangle_b+|-x \\rangle_a|+x \\rangle_b)|-x \\rangle_c]\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n         AliceBob\n    +x\n    -x\n    +y\n    -y\n   \n   \n    +x\n    +x\n    -x\n    -y\n    +y\n   \n   \n    -x\n    -x\n    +x\n    +y\n    -y\n   \n   \n    +y\n    -y\n    +y\n    +x\n    -x\n   \n   \n    -y\n    +y\n    -y\n    -x\n    +x\n   \n   \n    \n     \n    \n   \n  \n\n\nFrom the table it is clear that if Charlie\nknows what measurements Alice and Bob made (that is, x or\ny), he can determine whether their results are the same or\nopposite and also that he will gain no knowledge of what\ntheir results actually are. Similarly, Bob will not be able to\ndetermine what Alices’s result is without Charlie’s assistance\nbecause he does not know if his result is the same as Alice’s\nor the opposite of hers.\nWith each party choosing to make x or y measurements at\nrandom, only half of the GHZ triplets will give useful results. From the table we can know that if the basis used by Alice and Bob is certain, Charlie can get useful information only by using corresponding basis. \nWe assume\nthat there is an eavesdropper Eve (who could also be either\nBob or Charlie). Her problem is that she does not know what bases have been or\nwill be used to measure the particles. If she measures them\nherself and chooses the wrong bases, she will introduce errors that Alice, Bob, and Charlie will be able to detect by\npublicly comparing a subset of their measurements.\nIn order to show this for a large class of measurements, let\nus assume that Eve has been able to entangle an ancilla with\nthe three-particle state that Alice, Bob, and Charlie are using.\nAt some later time she can measure the ancilla to gain infor-\nmation about the measurement results of Alice, Bob, and\nCharlie. The state describing the state of the three particles\nand the ancilla is\n\n|\\Psi \\rangle=\\sum^1_{j,k,n=0}|jkn \\rangle_3|R_{jkn} \\rangle_\\xi\n\nwhere |jkn \\rangle_3 is a state of the three particles and |R_{jkn} \\rangle_\\xi is an\nunnormalized ancilla state. What we wish to show is that if\nthis entanglement introduces no errors into the secret sharing\nprocedure, then |\\Psi \\rangle must be a product of a GHZ triplet and\nthe ancilla. This implies that Eve will gain no information\nabout measurements on the triplet from observing the ancilla or, conversely, if Eve is to gain information about Alice’s\nbit, she must invariably introduce errors.\n(It is demonstrated by supposing the basis that Alice, Bob, and Charlie used. \n\nAll measure\ntheir particles in the x basis\nAlice measures her particle in the x\nbasis and Bob and Charlie measure theirs in the y basis.\nAlice measures her particle in the y direction, Bob measures his in the x direction, and Charlie measures his in\nthe y direction.\n)\n\nFinally, let us conclude this section with a discussion of\nthe resources necessary to implement quantum secret sharing\nprotocols. In order to send a shared key containing N bits it is\nnecessary to use, on average, 2N GHZ triplets. If we instead\nuse standard quantum cryptography and the classical secret\nsharing protocol, then either 4N entangled pairs, using the\nEkert procedure , or 4N particles, using the BB84 procedure, are required. In all cases, the number of particles\nsent from Alice to Bob and Charlie is 4N. In the GHZ\nscheme, once the key has been established, Alice needs to\nsend N classical bits in order to transmit the message. These\nbits can be sent to either Bob or Charlie using a public channel. In the hybrid quantum-classical scheme Alice must send\n2N classical bits once keys with Bob and Charlie have been\nestablished: N bits to send the random string to Charlie and\nanother N bits to send to Bob the string resulting from the\nbitwise XOR of the message and the random string. In general, the more parts into which the secret is split, the greater\nthe difference between the number of classical bits that must\nbe sent in the hybrid scheme and in the entangled-state\nscheme (MN versus N for a secret split into M parts). We see\nthat entanglement is able to act as a substitute for transmitted\nrandom bits.\n1.7.3.3. SPLITTING OF QUANTUM INFORMATION\nNow suppose that Alice has a string of qubits she would\nlike to send to Bob and Charlie in such a way that they must\ncooperate in order to extract the quantum information. She\ncan use shared GHZ triplets |000 \\rangle_{abc}+|111 \\rangle_{abc} and a procedure very similar to quantum teleportation to do this. The\nno-cloning theorem implies that only one copy of Alice’s\nqubit can be received, so that either Bob or Charlie, but not\nboth, will possess the final qubit. The procedure we shall\npresent is symmetric in that either party can end up with the\nfinal qubit, but information from the other party is required\nbefore this can happen. Security could be enforced by requiring that Bob and Charlie meet in person to exchange the final\ninformation and put the qubit to its final use.\nAlice begins by taking her qubit, which is in the state\n\\alpha|0 \\rangle_A +\\beta|1 \\rangle_A, combining it with her GHZ particle, and\nmeasuring the pair in the Bell basis.\nBob measure his particle and Alice tell Charlie the result of her measurement. Then Bob get the phase information while Charlie get the amplitude information. With the assistance of Bob, Charlie can reconstruct Alice's state.\n1.7.3.4. FOUR-PARTICLE GHZ STATE\nIt is possible to generalize this procedure to split information among more than two people. Let us look specifically at\nthe case of three. Alice starts with a four-particle GHZ state\n\n|\\Psi \\rangle_4=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0000 \\rangle+|1111 \\rangle)\n\nand keeps one particle for herself and gives one particle each\nto Bob, Charlie, and Diana. Her object is to generate a shared\nkey bit that can only be figured out by Bob, Charlie, and\nDiana if they cooperate.\nA method of accomplishing this can be found by expressing the state |\\Psi \\rangle_4 in different combinations of x and y bases.\nEach of the four parties performs a measurement on their particle in either the x or y basis. They then\ncommunicate their choice of basis to Alice (classically), who\ndecides if the overall basis choice is a usable one, and she\nthen communicates all four basis choices to each of the other\nthree parties. Using this information and the results of their\nmeasurements, they can, if they act in concert, determine the\nresult of Alice’s measurement. This means that Alice, on the\none hand, and Bob, Charlie, and Diana, on the other, will\nhave, on repeating this process, a shared key.\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)Quantum Secret Sharing\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"References.html":{"url":"References.html","title":"References","keywords":"","body":"1.8.

SPDC源收光\n从一束pump光经过BBO出来的两束光只有在相应位置才是同时产生的，由于BBO可能有偏转角度，产生的波长分别大致如图，因此收光的目标有两个，一是收到正中心的两束光，二是调整BBO使中心波长相同。总的目的是提高符合效率。\n使用中心波长为1550nm，宽度为30nm的滤波片后可根据计数判断是否取到中间的光，计数最大时即取到中心。\n收光时先调整耦合器，计数达到最大。再朝一个方向旋转BBO，使计数减小一半，再调耦合器至计数最大，看是否超过之前计数，若超过，则继续向此方向调整，否则向反方向调整。调好BBO后将一路计数调为最大，调整另一路的耦合器，使效率最大。调整耦合器时同一方向的角度与位移调整时相互配合，原则与上类似，不过调角度时不宜使计数降低过多。\n\n2.1.1.2.3. 轶事\n测量30m干涉的稳定性时曾经无论如何也看不到干涉条纹。将反射镜换为银镜，更换更好的激光都没用。最后发现是光纤的问题，使用的光纤对于该波长的激光来说不是单模光纤，将最后一节光纤换成单模光纤就出现完美的干涉图样。\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)04.09~04.12\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"9-Lab weekly journal/2019/04.15~04.19.html":{"url":"9-Lab weekly journal/2019/04.15~04.19.html","title":"04.15~04.19","keywords":"","body":"2.1.1.3. 4.15~4.192.1.1.3.1. 工作内容2.1.1.3.2. 轶事2.1.1.3. 4.15~4.19\n2.1.1.3.1. 工作内容\n凿壁偷光、测试玻璃，碳纤维板热膨胀系数对三十米干涉的影响、测试激光频率稳定性、测pockels cell电容\n2.1.1.3.2. 轶事\n\n原来实验室中间的墙只是表面一层铝板，里面填充石棉纤维\n光谱仪的配套程序竟然不是免费下载，卖硬件不提供软件的厂家真不厚道，另外下载真慢。\n读manual也是一项技能啊，测试激光频率稳定性的那天晚上就是读manual，想办法将数据导入电脑。它提供了通讯端口及相应命令，为什么不推荐几个软件呢？\n我觉得我们测的pockels cell电容并不怎么可靠，要在电容计自带十几pF电容的情况下测不超过4pF的电容，结果可想而知。\n\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)04.15~04.19\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"9-Lab weekly journal/2019/04.22~04.26.html":{"url":"9-Lab weekly journal/2019/04.22~04.26.html","title":"04.22~04.26","keywords":"","body":"2.1.1.4. 4.22~4.282.1.1.4.1. 工作内容2.1.1.4.2. 技术细节2.1.1.4.3. 轶事2.1.1.4. 4.22~4.28\n2.1.1.4.1. 工作内容\n尝试面向手册C语言编程、测试pockels cell 反应时间、寻找影响相位稳定性的因素\n2.1.1.4.2. 技术细节\n我们曾发现加上一块挡板后噪声变大，怀疑是声波反射到光路，从而影响相位。将光路搬到会议室后噪声似乎并没有减小。\n2.1.1.4.3. 轶事\n面向手册编程似乎是一件很重要的技能，可惜我不会……\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)04.22~04.26\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"9-Lab weekly journal/2019/05.13~05.17.html":{"url":"9-Lab weekly journal/2019/05.13~05.17.html","title":"05.13~05.17","keywords":"","body":"2.1.1.5. 5.13~5.172.1.1.5.1. 工作内容2.1.1.5.2. 技术细节2.1.1.5.3. 轶事2.1.1.5. 5.13~5.17\n2.1.1.5.1. 工作内容\n测激光器波长分布、收拾实验室\n2.1.1.5.2. 技术细节\n色散补偿器可以用来补偿色散，但这里用来增加色散以拉开不同波长光的到达时间。\n色散补偿器有两种，一种是光纤色散补偿器，得到的结果比较平滑，但体积较大。另一种是啁啾光栅色散补偿器，体积较小。\n2.1.1.5.3. 轶事\n实验室激光器功率还是很高的，小心烫伤。\n黑布是阻燃的，但烧穿黑布后如果打到窗帘上那后果不堪设想。\n似乎黑布后面是一个铁架子，不过还是建议窗帘换成阻燃的。\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)05.13~05.17\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"9-Lab weekly journal/2019/05.20~05.31.html":{"url":"9-Lab weekly journal/2019/05.20~05.31.html","title":"05.20~05.31","keywords":"","body":"2.1.1.6. 5.20~5.312.1.1.6.1. 工作内容2.1.1.6.2. 技术细节2.1.1.6.2.1. 实验原理2.1.1.6.2.2. 实际情况2.1.1.6.3. 轶事2.1.1.6. 5.20~5.31\n2.1.1.6.1. 工作内容\n使用SPIDER（Spectral Phase Interferometry for\nDirect Electric-field Reconstruction）方法测激光器不同波长之间的相位差\\times 4\n2.1.1.6.2. 技术细节\n2.1.1.6.2.1. 实验原理\n\n\n2.1.1.6.2.2. 实际情况\n\n实验中是通过将一束光等光程先分再合，再插入玻璃片实现延时的。玻璃片的厚度决定延时\\tau的大小，同时决定了光谱干涉条纹的密集程度。玻璃片越厚，\\tau越大，条纹越密集，对谱仪分辨率要求越高。\n光谱仪的分辨率可通过调节狭缝的大小控制。狭缝越小，分辨率越高，单位时间内的计数越少。因此需要选取合适的狭缝宽度以及曝光时间。分辨率过低，不能得到干涉中降到底的图象。分辨率过高，计数较少，统计误差影响较大。若通过增加曝光时间提高计数，则会出现对时间平均后对比度下降的问题。\nBBO晶体是非线性晶体，不仅可以用来实现SPDC，若实现相位匹配，也可以用来倍频与和频。实现和频是这一实验的难点。由于光栅不能承受高功率的激光，生成的紫光不明显。最开始采用非共线的方法，这样信噪比高，和频光在两个倍频光之间，但调节难度极高，最后放弃。后来采用共线的方法。这时较容易看到紫光，但信噪比低。调节时需要挡住一路光，看紫光是否消失，以判断是否为和频光。\n如果两光栅平行度足够好，经过色散的光打到反射镜后是可以原路返回，重新变成一个光斑的。因此调节光栅平行至关重要。大致使得第二个光栅出来的衍射光与激光器出来的光平行可得到较好的平行度，再做微调，使得逐渐挡住反射镜上的光使得光斑只有亮度变化，而无形状变化，则说明已经调好。\n色散光与延时光两路需要能够发生干涉，因此光程需要大致相等。实验中通过步进电机控制的平移台调节直角反射镜对的位置使两边光程差在相干长度的范围内。这一对反射镜要垂直，平移台一定要与光路平行，否则调整时光斑会发生较大偏移。\n\n2.1.1.6.3. 轶事\n我们一共测了四次，将光栅距离改短，改长，再改短。要实现和仪器的分辨率相匹配也不是一件容易的事情。\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)05.20~05.31\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"9-Lab weekly journal/2019/06.03~06.06.html":{"url":"9-Lab weekly journal/2019/06.03~06.06.html","title":"06.03~06.06","keywords":"","body":"2.1.1.7. 6.3~6.62.1.1.7.1. 工作内容2.1.1.7.2. 细节2.1.1.7. 6.3~6.6\n2.1.1.7.1. 工作内容\n测试PBS、BD的透过率，反射镜的反射率。搭纠缠源。\n2.1.1.7.2. 细节\nPBS透过率约99%，不达标，BD透过率约99.6%，反射镜反射率约99.9%\n由于光学元件对光强的损耗较低，我们只能测多个元件共同的损耗，以得到平均透过率与反射率。同时由于激光器功率不够稳定，光强波动范围已经接近我们要测量的变化。我们发现光强的波动有一定的周期性，而且其最大值较稳定，因此我们计算透过率与折射率时采用一段时间内的最大值计算。\n入射角对反射镜的反射率影响很大。测一种设计入射角为0^\\circ的反射镜的反射率时，由于0^\\circ入射不便于搭光路，我们使入射角为45^\\circ，测得反射率仅为98%左右。当改为0^\\circ后，反射率变为99.9%\nSPDC两参量光间隔较小，约5mm，两光斑直径各1mm，间距3mm。\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)06.03~06.06\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"9-Lab weekly journal/2019/06.28~07.30.html":{"url":"9-Lab weekly journal/2019/06.28~07.30.html","title":"06.28~07.30","keywords":"","body":"2.1.1.8. 6.28~7.302.1.1.8.1. 工作内容2.1.1.8.2. 技术细节2.1.1.8.2.1.
