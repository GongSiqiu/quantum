Experimental Realization of Wheeler's Delayed-Choice Gedanken Experiment[1]1.2.2. Experimental Realization of Wheeler's Delayed-Choice Gedanken Experiment[1]\nWe report the\nrealization of such a delayed-choice experiment\nin a scheme close to the ideal original proposal.\nThe delayed-choice scheme is implemented\nas follows. Linearly polarized single photons are\nsent by a polarization beamsplitter BS input\nthrough an interferometer (length 48 m) with\ntwo spatially separated paths associated with\northogonal S and P polarizations (Fig. 2). The\nmovable output beamsplitter BS output consists of\nthe combination of a half-wave plate, a polarization beamsplitter BS′, an electro-optical modulaor (EOM) with its optical axis oriented at 22.5°\nfrom input polarizations, and a Wollaston prism.\nThe two beams of the interferometer, which are\nspatially separated and orthogonally polarized,\nare first overlapped by BS′ but can still be\nunambiguously identified by their polarization.\nThen, the choice between the two interferometer\nconfigurations, closed or open, is realized with\nthe EOM, which can be switched between two\ndifferent configurations within 40 ns by means of\na homebuilt fast driver: Either no voltage is\napplied to the EOM, or its half-wave voltage V p is\napplied to it. In the first case, the situation\ncorresponds to the removal of BS output and the\ntwo paths remain uncombined (open configuration). Because the original S and P polarizations of the two paths are oriented along prism\npolarization eigenstates, each “click” of one\ndetector D1 or D2 placed on the output ports is\nassociated with a specific path (path 1 or path 2,\nrespectively). When the V p voltage is applied, the\nEOM is equivalent to a half-wave plate that\nrotates the input polarizations by an angle of 45°.\nThe prism then recombines the two rotated\npolarizations that have traveled along different\noptical paths, and interference appears on the two\noutput ports. We then have the closed interferometer configuration.\n \n\nAny description in\nwhich light is treated as a classical wave, such as\nthe semiclassical theory with quantized photo-detectors , predicts that these numbers of\ncounts should obey the inequality\n\n\\alpha=\\frac{N_C\\times N_T}{N_1\\times N_2}\\ge 1\n\nViolation of this inequality thus gives a quantitative criterion that characterizes nonclassical\nbehavior. For a single-photon wavepacket, quantum optics predicts perfect anticorrelation (i.e.,\na = 0) in agreement with the intuitive image that\na single particle cannot be detected simultaneously in the two paths of the interferometer\n(2). We measured a = 0.12 ± 0.01, hence we are\nindeed close to the pure single-photon regime.\nOur realization of Wheeler’s delayed-choice\ngedanken experiment demonstrates that the\nbehavior of the photon in the interferometer\ndepends on the choice of the observable that is\nmeasured, even when that choice is made at a\nposition and a time such that it is separated from\nthe entrance of the photon into the interferometer\nby a space-like interval.\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)Experimental Realization Of Wheeler S Delayed Choice Gedanken Experiment\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"1-Basic knowledge/Measurement of Subpicosecond Time Intervals between Two Photons by Interference.html":{"url":"1-Basic knowledge/Measurement of Subpicosecond Time Intervals between Two Photons by Interference.html","title":"Measurement Of Subpicosecond Time Intervals Between Two Photons By Interference","keywords":"","body":"1.2.3.

Measurement of Subpicosecond Time Intervals between Two Photons by Interference [2]\nThis experiment is widely used to ensure the indistinguishability of two bosonic particles in the experiment.\nIt should be emphasized that the signal and idler photons have no\ndefinite phase, and are therefore mutually incoherent, in\nthe sense that they exhibit no second-order interference\nwhen brought together at detector D1 or D2. However,\nfourth-order interference effects occur, as demonstrated\nby the coincidence counting rate between D1 and D2.\nAlthough the sum frequency \\omega_1+\\omega_2 is very well\ndefined in the experiment, the individual down-shifted\nfrequencies \\omega_1,\\omega_2  have large uncertainties, that, in practice, are largely determined by the pass bands of the in-\nterference filters IF inserted in the down-shifted beams,\nas shown in Fig. 1.\n \n\nThe joint probability is\n\nP_{12}(\\tau)=K|G(0)|^2\\{T^2|g(\\tau)|^2+R^2|g(2\\delta\\tau-\\tau)|^2-RT[g^*(\\tau)g(2\\delta\\tau-\\tau)+c.c]\\}\n\nwhere G(t)​ is the Fourier transform of the weight function \\phi(\\omega_0/2+\\omega,\\omega_0/2-\\omega)​ with respect to \\omega ​\n\nG(\\tau)=\\int\\phi(\\omega_0/2+\\omega,\\omega_0/2-\\omega)e^{-\\mathrm{i}\\omega\\tau}\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{d}\\omega\n\nand g(\\tau)\\equiv G(\\tau)/G(0)\nThe\nexpected number N_c of observed photon coincidences is\nthen given by \n\nN_c=C\\left[R^2+T^2-2RT\\frac{\\int^\\infty_{-\\infty}g(\\tau)g(\\tau-2\\delta\\tau)\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{d}\\tau}{\\int^\\infty_{-\\infty}g^2(\\tau)\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{d}\\tau} \\right]\n\nIn the special case when g(\\omega_0/2+\\omega,\\omega_0/2-\\omega) is\nGaussian in w with bandwidth \\Delta\\omega, then g(\\tau) has the\nGaussian form\n\ng(\\tau)=e^{-(\\Delta\\omega\\tau)^2/2}\n\n\nN_c=C(T^2+R^2)\\left[1-\\frac{2RT}{R^2+T^2}e^{-(\\Delta\\omega\\delta\\tau)^2} \\right]\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)Measurement Of Subpicosecond Time Intervals Between Two Photons By Interference\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"1-Basic knowledge/Probing Quantum Commutation Rules by Addition and Subtraction of Single Photons to or from a Light Field.html":{"url":"1-Basic knowledge/Probing Quantum Commutation Rules by Addition and Subtraction of Single Photons to or from a Light Field.html","title":"Probing Quantum Commutation Rules By Addition And Subtraction Of Single Photons To Or From A Light Field","keywords":"","body":"1.2.4. Probing Quantum Commutation Rules by Addition and Subtraction of Single Photons to/from a Light Field [3]1.2.4. Probing Quantum Commutation Rules by Addition and Subtraction of Single Photons to/from a Light Field [3]\nAs the final states depend on the order in which the two actions are performed, we directly\nobserved the noncommutativity of the creation and annihilation operators\nif the particles were photons in a single-mode radiation\nfield, one would naturally use the bosonic creation and annihilation operators \\hat{a}^\\dagger and \\hat{a} to perform the addition and the subtraction of single\nphotons to and from the light field. Indeed, for the\ngeneral case of a quantum light field described by a density matrix \\hat{\\rho} , there is a broad consensus in\ncalling the result of the application of the creation\n(annihilation) operator, \\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{a}(\\hat{a}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{a}^\\dagger), the “photon-\nadded” (“-subtracted”) state, after proper normalization. This tendency derives from the fact that,\nwhen the photon creation operator a % † acts on a\nstate with a well-defined number n of photons\n(also called a Fock or number state, and denoted\nby jn〉), it increases this number by one:\n\n\\hat{a}^\\dagger |n\\rangle=\\sqrt{n+1}|n+1\\rangle\n\nConversely, when the photon annihilation\noperator \\hat{a} acts on the same state, it subtracts a\nquantum of excitation, thus reducing the number\nof photons in the state by exactly one\n\n\\hat{a} |n\\rangle=\\sqrt{n}|n-1\\rangle\n\nWhen the initial number of particles is precisely known, the quantum and the classical cases give\nexactly the same results for arbitrary sequences of\nadditions and subtractions. However, the situation\nchanges completely for general superpositions or\nmixtures of Fock states.\nIt simply derives from the misleading implicit assumption that a deterministic addition and\nsubtraction of particles can be represented by the\ncreation and annihilation operators which, on the\ncontrary, work in a probabilistic way.\n \n\nA single click\nsimply conditions the generation of a photon-\nadded or photon-subtracted thermal state, whereas\na double click can either produce a first-subtracted-\nthen-added thermal state or vice versa, depending\non the combination of clicks.\n \n\nThe first interesting result appears when comparing the mean photon numbers of the states:\nFor the photon-added state one finds, quite naturally, that the mean photon number is larger\nthan in the original thermal light state, but unexpectedly the same result occurs for the photon-\nsubtracted state. The operation of removing one\nphoton from the field has increased (doubled) its\nfinal mean photon number. Such an increase also\ntakes place for the sequence of operators that\nshould intuitively bring the field back to the\ninitial state.\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)Probing Quantum Commutation Rules By Addition And Subtraction Of Single Photons To Or From A Light Field\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"1-Basic knowledge/Ruling Out Multi-Order Interference in Quantum Mechanics.html":{"url":"1-Basic knowledge/Ruling Out Multi-Order Interference in Quantum Mechanics.html","title":"Ruling Out Multi Order Interference In Quantum Mechanics","keywords":"","body":"1.2.5.

The new source allowed ready preparation of all\nfour of the EPR-Bell states.\nTo date, most of the experiments with photons from\nspontaneous parametric down conversion have used type-I\nphase matching, in which the correlated photons have the\nsame polarization. There, for the case of degenerate\nemission, a pair of photons with equal wavelength emerge\non a cone, which is centered on the pump beam and whose opening angle depends on the angle 6pm\nbetween the crystal optic axis and the pump. With type-II\nphase matching, the down—converted photons are emitted\ninto two cones, one ordinary polarized, the other\nextraordinary polarized. In the collinear situation\nthe two cones are tangent to one another on exactly one\nline, namely, the pump beam direction. If 6pm is\ndecreased, the two cones will separate from each other\nentirely. However, if the angle is increased, the two\ncones tilt toward the pump, causing an intersection along\ntwo lines (see Fig. 1). Along the two directions\n(“1” and “2”), where the cones overlap, the light can be\nessentially described by an entangled state:\n\n|\\psi \\rangle=(|H_1,V_2 \\rangle+e^{i \\alpha}|V_1,H_2 \\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}\n\nwhere H and V indicate horizontal (extraordinary) and\nvertical (ordinary) polarization, respectively. The relative\nphase oz arises from the crystal birefringence, and an\noverall phase shift is omitted.\nBecause the photons are produced coherently along the\nentire length of the crystal, one can completely compensate for the longitudinal walk-off—after compensation, interference occurs pairwise between processes\nwhere the photon pair is created at distances \\pm x from the\nmiddle of the crystal. The ideal compensation therefore\nuses two crystals, one in each path, which are identical\nto the down-conversion crystal, but only half as long. If\nthe polarization of the light is first rotated by 90° (e.g.,\nwith a half wave plate), the retardations of the o and the\ne components are exchanged and complete temporal indistinguishability is restored (\\delta T=0). The same\nmethod provides the optimal compensation for the transverse\nwalk-off effect as well\n\n\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)New High Intensity Source Of Polarization Entangled Photon Pairs\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"2-Single-photon sources/Push-button photon entanglement.html":{"url":"2-Single-photon sources/Push-button photon entanglement.html","title":"Push Button Photon Entanglement","keywords":"","body":"1.3.2.

Photon source\nAn intrinsic problem in the SPDC, however,is that the photon pairs are generated probabilistically,\nand mixed with double pair emission. To scale up to a larger number of photons and fast sampling rate, a more efficient route is to use single-photon sources that emit one and only one photon each time. Here is quantum dot(QD) micropillar.\n1.4.2.2. Scheme\n \n\nFor each experimental period, M time bins(each loaded with one or zero photon) are injected into a loop by an acousto-optical modulator (AOM) and circulated for N loops. Such a loop-based architecture is equivalent to an M-mode beam splitter network with a depth of N, as illustrated in Fig(b). Here, the polarization degree of freedom acts as the spatial mode in the conventional boson sampling model. The beam splitter operations, denoted by the circles in Fig(b), are effectively realized using a polarization-rotation electro-optic modulator (p-EOM) with dynamically programmable coupling ratio. After the p-EOM, a polarization-dependent asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer delays the vertical polarization for one time-bin length (∼13 ns), regarding to the horizontal polarization, which realizes the displacement operation of the time bins. After N loops of evolution, the M bins are ejected out of the loop by another AOM, and the output distributions are obtained by registering all of the single-photon detectionevents in real time and postprocessing . We calibrate the mode matching of the time-bin loop using Mach-Zehnder interference. The time-bin encoding scheme naturally complements the single-photon pulse train.\n1.4.2.3. Strength\nThe loop-based architecture is intrinsically stable, electrically programmable, and resource efficient. For an arbitrary n-boson sampling, this scheme requires only one single-photon emitter, two optical switches, two EOMs, and two fast detectors, whereas the traditional spatial-encoding approach requires n-1 optical switches,  \\sim n^4   beam splitters, and \\sim n^2detectors.  Furthermore, it relaxes the overhead of actively demultiplexing a single-photon source or building an array of multiple identical single-photon sources\n1.4.2.4. limitation\nThe overall efficiency of the current experiment is\nmainly limited by the system efficiency of the single-\nphoton source (∼24.7%, due to losses in light extraction,cross polarization, optical path transmission, and fiber coupling), transmission of the loop-based interferometer(∼83.4% per loop), and single-photon detection efficiency(∼52%).\n1.4.2.5. Error\nThe slight fidelity decrease might be mainly due to the mode mismatching (0.5%) per loop\n1.4.2.6. Significance\nThe flexible loop-based architecture in this experiment further allows us to track the dynamical multiphoton evolution in the circuit at intermediate time. This experiment opens a new way to study multiparticle high-dimensional quantum walks with single quantum emitters, and opens up a new avenue to multiphoton quantum computation with single quantum emitters, and brings boson sampling closer to an experimental regime approaching quantum supremacy.\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)Time Bin Encoded Boson Sampling With A Single Photon Device\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"4-Quantum manipulation/":{"url":"4-Quantum manipulation/","title":"Quantum Manipulation","keywords":"","body":"1.5.

However, usually the uncontrolled entanglement in the frequency and/or time\ncan significantly degrade the entanglement in the polarization.\nFurther, beam-like SPDC  was\ndeveloped with the photon pairs in the form of two separate Gaussian-like beams, which\nhad higher brightness and efficiency coupling into a single spatial mode than\nthose from the non-collinear SPDC where the collection was at intersections of the two\ndown-converted photon rings.\nGenerally, due to conservation of momentum in SPDC, a lower momentum\nuncertainty of pump beam can lead to a higher collection efficiency.

Nevertheless, it is still an open question how well\none can copy quantum states, i.e., when ideal copies are not\navailable how close the copy state (out state in the mode b)\ncan be to the original state (i.e., |s \\rangle_a ). The other question to\nanswer is what happens to the original state |s \\rangle_a after the\ncopying.\nWith the advent of\nquantum communication, e.g., quantum cryptography, and\nquantum computing, understanding the limits of the manipu-\nlations we can perform on quantum information becomes\nimportant.\n1.5.2.2. WOOTTERS-ZUREK QUANTUM-COPYING MACHINE AND NONCLONING THEOREM\nIn their paper Wootters and Zurek analyzed the copying process defined by the transformation relation on basis\nvectors |0\\rangle_a and |1\\rangle_a :\n\n|0\\rangle_a|Q\\rangle_x\\rightarrow|0\\rangle_a|0\\rangle_b|Q_0\\rangle_x\n\n\n|1\\rangle_a|Q\\rangle_x\\rightarrow|1\\rangle_a|1\\rangle_b|Q_1\\rangle_x\n\nwe can assume\nthat\n\n\\sideset{_x}{_x} {\\langle Q|Q\\rangle}=\\sideset{_x}{_x} {\\langle Q_0|Q_0\\rangle}=\\sideset{_x}{_x} {\\langle Q_1|Q_1\\rangle}=1\n\nThe Wootters-Zurek (WZ) quantum-copying machine\n(QCM) is defined in such a way that the basis vectors |0\\rangle_a\nand |1\\rangle_a are copied (that is, cloned) ideally, that is, for these\nstates the relation (1.1) is fulfilled.\nThe Hilbert-Schmidt norm of an operator Â is given by\n\n\\|\\hat{A}\\|_2=[\\text{Tr}(\\hat{A}^\\dagger\\hat{A})]^{1/2}\n\nOur distance between the density matrices \\hat{\\rho}_1 and \\hat{\\rho}_2 is then\n\nD=(\\|\\hat{\\rho}_1-\\hat{\\rho}_2\\|_2)^2\n\nOther measures of the similarity of two density matrices\nhave been used. Schumacher  has advocated the use of\nfidelity which is defined as\n\nF=\\text{Tr}(\\hat{\\rho}_1^{1/2}\\hat{\\rho}_2\\hat{\\rho}_1^{1/2})^{1/2}\\tag{2.1}\n\n1.5.2.3. INPUT-STATE-INDEPENDENT QUANTUM-COPYING MACHINE\nWhen using this 'universal'\nquantum-copying machine (UQCM) superposition states\n\n|s\\rangle_a=\\alpha|0\\rangle_a+\\beta|1\\rangle_a\n\n are copied equally well for any value of a in the sense\n2\nthat the distances D_a=\\text{Tr}[\\hat{\\rho}_a^{(out)}-\\hat{\\rho}_a^{(id)}]^2\nand D_{ab}=\\text{Tr}[\\hat{\\rho}_{ab}^{(out)}-\\hat{\\rho}_{ab}^{(id)}]^2 do not depend on the parameter \\alpha.\nThe most general quantum-copying transformation rules\nfor pure states on a two-dimensional space can be written as\n\n|0 \\rangle_a|Q \\rangle_x\\rightarrow\\sum^1_{k,l=0}|k \\rangle_a|l \\rangle_b|Q_{kl} \\rangle_x,\n\n\n|1 \\rangle_a|Q \\rangle_x\\rightarrow\\sum^1_{m,n=0}|m \\rangle_a|n \\rangle_b|Q_{mn} \\rangle_x,\n\nwhere the states |Q_{mn} \\rangle_x are not necessarily orthonormal for all possible values of m and n. The general copying transformation is very complex and it involves many free parameters \\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Q_{kl}|Q_{mn}\\rangle } which characterize the copying machine.\nIn what follows we will concentrate our attention on one\nparticular copying transformation which fulfills our demands\nas described above. We propose the transformation\n\n|0 \\rangle_a|Q \\rangle_x\\rightarrow|0 \\rangle_a|0 \\rangle_b|Q_0 \\rangle_x+[|0 \\rangle_a|1 \\rangle_b+|1 \\rangle_a|0 \\rangle_b]|Y_0 \\rangle_x\n\n\n|1 \\rangle_a|Q \\rangle_x\\rightarrow|1 \\rangle_a|1 \\rangle_b|Q_1 \\rangle_x+[|0 \\rangle_a|1 \\rangle_b+|1 \\rangle_a|0 \\rangle_b]|Y_1 \\rangle_x\n\nwhich is an obvious generalization of the WZ QCM. Due to\nthe unitarity of the transformation (3.2) the following relations hold:\n\n\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Q_i|Q_i \\rangle}+2\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Y_i|Y_i \\rangle}=1,\\quad i=0,1\n\n\n\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Y_0|Y_1 \\rangle}=\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Y_1|Y_0 \\rangle}=0\n\nThere are still many free parameters to specify, therefore we\nwill further assume that the copying-machine state vectors\n|Y_i \\rangle_x and |Q_i \\rangle_x are mutually orthogonal:\n\n\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Q_i|Y_i \\rangle}=0, \\quad i=0,1\n\nand that\n\n\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Q_0|Q_1 \\rangle}=0\n\nThe Hilbert-Schmidt norm\n\nD_a=2 \\xi^2(4 \\alpha^4-4 \\alpha^2+1)+2 \\alpha^2(1- \\alpha^2)(\\eta-1)^2\n\nwhere we have introduced the notation\n\n\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Y_0|Y_0 \\rangle}=\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Y_1|Y_1 \\rangle}=\\xi\n\n\n\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Y_0|Q_1 \\rangle}=\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Q_0|Y_1 \\rangle}=\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Q_1|Y_0 \\rangle}=\\sideset{x}{x}{ \\langle Y_1|Q_0 \\rangle}=\\eta/2\n\nWe find that if the parameters j and h are related as\n\n\\eta=1-2 \\xi\n\nthen the norm D a is input-state independent and it takes the\nvalue\n\nD_a=2 \\xi^2\n\n\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha^2}D_{ab}^{(2)}=0\n\nwe find  \\xi =1/6. For this value of \\xi  the norm D_{ab}is \\alphaindependent and its value is equal to 2/9.\n1.5.2.3.1. Some properties of the UQCM\n\nAny measurement performed on mode b affects the\nstate of mode a.\nOnce we have found the basis in which both density operators \\hat{\\rho}^{(id)}\nand \\hat{\\rho}^{(out)}\nare diagonal we can easily find the\nvalue of the fidelity parameter F a as introduced by Schumacher. The fidelity parameter which we are interested in is\ngiven by Eq.(2.1) with \\hat{\\rho}_1=\\hat{\\rho}_a^{(id)} and \\hat{\\rho}_2=\\hat{\\rho}_a^{(out)}\nIn our case the fidelity is equal to a constant value \\sqrt{5/6} for all input\nstates. We can conclude that the UQCM has that universal\nproperty to be input-state independent, that is, all pure states\nare copied equally well.\n\n1.5.2.4. MEASUREMENT OF THE ORIGINAL AND THE COPY STATE AT THE OUTPUT OF QCM\nIn summary the output from the UQCM has the following\nproperty. If any projection is measured in the b mode the\nunconditioned a-mode ensemble which results is close to the\nideal output state, i.e., the input state, and can be used to find\nthe expectation value of any a-mode operator in the ideal\noutput state. In addition, the b-mode measurement provides\nus with information about the input state.\n1.5.2.5. COPYING STATES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF GIVEN STATE\nWhat we can do\nwith the output of this copying machine is to use it to calcu-\nlate the expectation values of any operator which annihilates\nthis state.\n1.5.2.6. CONCLUSIONS\nA problem with all of these machines is that the copy and\noriginal which appear at the output are entangled. This\nmeans that a measurement of one affects the other. We\nfound, however, that a nonselective measurement of one of\nthe output modes will provide information about the input\nstate and not disturb the reduced density matrix of the other\nmode. Therefore the output of these copying machines is\nuseful.\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)Quantum Copying Beyond The No Cloning Theorem\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"4-Quantum manipulation/Teleporting an unknown quantum state via dual classical and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen channels.html":{"url":"4-Quantum manipulation/Teleporting an unknown quantum state via dual classical and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen channels.html","title":"Teleporting An Unknown Quantum State Via Dual Classical And Einstein Podolsky Rosen Channels","keywords":"","body":"1.5.3.

Communication via one- and two-particle operators on Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states[12]1.7.1. Communication via one- and two-particle operators on Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states[12]\nAs is well known, operations on one particle of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair cannot\ninfluence the marginal statistics of measurements on the other particle. We characterize the set of states\naccessible from an initial EPR state by one-particle operations and show that in a sense they allow two\nbits to be encoded reliably in one spin-\\frac{1}{2} particle: One party, “Alice,” prepares an EPR pair and sends\none of the particles to another party, “Bob,” who applies one of four unitary operators to the particle,\nand then returns it to Alice. By measuring the two particles jointly, Alice can now reliably learn which\noperator Bob used.\nWe show that such interactions can be used to\nprepare all and only those states of the joint system (two\nparticles and ancilla) that yield unperturbed marginal\nstatistics for all measurements on the other particle, with\nwhich the ancilla did not interact.\nWe now demonstrate the equivalence between states\naccessible through one-particle operators and states with\nrandom marginal statistics for the untreated particle.\nA general expression for a pure state of the tripartite\nsystem comprising the two EPR particles and the ancilla is\n\n|\\Phi \\rangle=|\\uparrow\\uparrow \\rangle|A \\rangle+|\\downarrow\\downarrow \\rangle|B \\rangle+|\\uparrow\\downarrow \\rangle|C \\rangle+|\\uparrow\\uparrow \\rangle|D \\rangle\n\n\n\\langle A|A \\rangle +\\langle B|B \\rangle+\\langle C|C \\rangle+\\langle D|D \\rangle=1\n\n\n|\\phi \\rangle=\\frac{\\cos \\theta}{\\sqrt{2}}(e^{i \\alpha}|\\uparrow\\uparrow \\rangle+e^{i \\beta}|\\downarrow\\downarrow \\rangle)+\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\sqrt{2}}(e^{i \\gamma}|\\uparrow\\downarrow \\rangle+e^{i \\delta}|\\downarrow\\uparrow \\rangle)\n\\tag{1}\n\n\n\\delta+\\gamma=\\pi+\\alpha+\\beta \\tag{2}\n\nThe symmetry of Eqs. (1) and (2) with respect to the\ncoefficients of |\\uparrow\\downarrow \\rangle and |\\downarrow\\uparrow \\rangle implies that unitary operations on one particle of an EPR pair, without ancilla, cannot influence the marginal statistics of either particle, not\neven the one the operator has acted upon.\nIt is noteworthy that the manifold defined by Eqs. (1)\nand (2), i.e., the set of states preparable by one-particle\nunitary operators on an initial EPR state, is a proper subset, but not a subspace, of all two-particle pure states.\nIt includes states such as\n\n\\begin{align}\n&\\sqrt{1/2}(|\\uparrow\\downarrow \\rangle-|\\downarrow\\uparrow \\rangle),\\sqrt{1/2}(|\\uparrow\\downarrow \\rangle+|\\downarrow\\uparrow \\rangle),\\\\\n&\\sqrt{1/2}(|\\uparrow\\uparrow \\rangle-|\\downarrow\\downarrow \\rangle),\\sqrt{1/2}(|\\uparrow\\uparrow \\rangle+|\\downarrow\\downarrow \\rangle),\\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\nThe orthonormality of Eq. (3) means that manipulations of one particle of a separated EPR pair, while they\ncannot be used to communicate directly with the untreated particle, can be used to encode four reliably distinguishable messages in the two-particle system. To perform this feat, Alice, the intended receiver of the message, first prepares a pure EPR state and lends one particle of the pair to Bob, the intended sender. Bob then\noperates on the particle via one of four unitary operators\nso as to put the two-particle system into a chosen one of\nthe four states of Eq. (3) and then returns the treated\nparticle to Alice. Now possessing both particles, Alice\ncan in principle measure them jointly in the orthonormal\nbasis of Eq. (3), and so reliably learn which operator\nBob applied.\nFrom one viewpoint, this is surprising, because Bob has\ncommunicated a two-bit message by unitarily operating\non a single spin-\\frac{1}{2} particle. Thinking too classically, one\nmight be tempted to say that his manipulations have\ntherefore placed the treated particle into four reliably distinguishable states, contradicting a basic principle of\nquantum mechanics that such a particle can have only\ntwo reliably distinguishable states. But the scheme also\ndepends on the untreated particle. It therefore might be\nbetter to say, as Schumacher suggests, that one of the\ntwo bits is sent forward in time through the treated particle, while the other bit is sent backward in time to the\nEPR source, then forward in time through the untreated\nparticle, until finally it is combined with the bit in the\ntreated particle to reconstitute the two-bit message. Because the bit “sent backward in time” cannot be used to\ntransmit a meaningful message without the help of the\nother particle, no opportunity for time travel or superluminal communication is created, just as none is created\nin the classic EPR experiment in which simultaneous\nmeasurements are used to establish non-message-bearing\ncorrelations over a spacelike interval.\nThe EPR scheme has the advantage of allowing some of\nthe particle transmissions to take place before the message has been decided upon, perhaps at cheaper “off-peak” rates.\n\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)Communication Via One And Two Particle Operators On Einstein Podolsky Rosen States\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"6-Quantum communication/Quantum Cryptography Using Any Two Nonorthogonal States.html":{"url":"6-Quantum communication/Quantum Cryptography Using Any Two Nonorthogonal States.html","title":"Quantum Cryptography Using Any Two Nonorthogonal States","keywords":"","body":"1.7.2.

Quantum Cryptography Using Any Two Nonorthogonal States[13]\nHere we show that in principle any two nonorthogonal quantum states\nsuffice, and describe a practical interferometric realization using low-intensity coherent light pulses.\nTwo of the main\ngoals of cryptography: encrypting a subsequent meaningful message to make it unintelligible to a third party,\nand certifying to the legitimate receiver that a message\n(plain or encrypted) has not been altered in transit.\nThe security of non-EPR key distribution\nschemes is derived from the fact that any measurement\nwhich fails to disturb each of two nonorthogonal states\nalso fails to yield any information distinguishing them.\nLet |u_0\\rangle​and  |u_1\\rangle​ be two distinct, nonorthogonal states,\nand let P_0=1-|u_1\\rangle\\langle u_1|​ and P_1=1-|u_0\\rangle\\langle u_0|​ be (noncommuting) projection operators onto subspaces orthogonal to |u_0\\rangle​ and  |u_1\\rangle​, respectively (note reversed order of\nindices). Thus P_0​ annihilates |u_1​, but yields a positive\nresult with probability\n1-|\\langle u_0| u_1\\rangle|^2​ when applied to\n|u_0\\rangle​, and vice versa for P_1​ \nTo begin the key distribution, Alice prepares and sends\nBob a random binary sequence of quantum systems, using\nstates |u_0\\rangle​ and |u_1\\rangle​ to represent the bits 0 and 1, respectively. Bob then decides, randomly and independently of\nAlice for each system, whether to subject it to a measurement of  P_0​ or P_1​. Next Bob publicly tells Alice in which\ninstances his measurement had a positive result (but not,of course, which measurement he made), and the two\nparties agree to discard all the other instances.\nIf there has been no eavesdropping, the remaining instances, a fraction approximately (1-|\\langle u_0| u_1\\rangle|^2)/2 of\nthe original trials, should be perfectly correlated, consisting entirely of instances in which Alice sent |u_0\\rangle and Bob\nmeasured P_0, or Alice sent |u_1\\rangle and Bob measured P_1.\nHowever, before Alice and Bob can trust this data as key,\nthey must, as in other key distribution schemes, sacrifice\nsome of it to verify that their versions of the key are\nindeed identical. This also certifies the absence of eavesdropping, which would necessarily have disturbed the\nstates |u_0\\rangle or|u_1\\rangle in transit, causing them sometimes to\nyield positive results when later subjected to measurements P_1 or P_0​ , respectively.\n\nThis third pulse contains no phase information, but serves to confirm that the reference pulse has actually arrived. It thus protects against an attack in which\nan eavesdropper (“Eve”) would measure each signal-\nreference pulse pair by an apparatus similar to Bob's,\nresend a correctly fabricated pulse pair whenever she was\nsuccessful, and suppress both the signal and reference\npulses when she was unsuccessful, thereby eavesdropping\non the channel without creating errors in Bob's subsequent measurement results. Eve cannot suppress the\nreference pulse without immediately being caught. But if\nshe suppresses only the signal pulse, the uncancelled reference pulse will still produce a count in Bob's detector\nwith probability ,\\mu Tq, and half these counts will result in\nerrors in Bob's key.\nSince any pair of coherent or incoherent optical signals\nbecome significantly nonorthogonal at low intensity, it\nwould seem that almost any source of two kinds of dim\nlight flash could be used for key distribution\nwithout the complications of interferometry. However,\na more intrusive Eve, who stands between Alice and Bob,\ncan thoroughly subvert the scheme by intercepting all AIice’s flashes, and resending a flash to Bob\nonly when she succeeds in seeing Alice’s flash herself,\nwhile simply stopping the others. By contrast, in the interferometric scheme of Fig. 2, there is no fake signal an\neavesdropper can substitute to hide her failure to detect\nthe original signal, and the scheme remains secure.\nQuantum Notes by Gong Siqiu (龚思秋)Quantum Cryptography Using Any Two Nonorthogonal States\nnote,quantum\nRecord the note when I read the papers about quantum.(maybe most of them are just extracted from the papers)"},"References.html":{"url":"References.html","title":"References","keywords":"","body":"1.8.
