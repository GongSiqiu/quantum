# Experimental Realization of Wheeler's Delayed-Choice Gedanken Experiment{{"Jacques2007"|cite}}

We report the
realization of such a delayed-choice experiment
in a scheme close to the ideal original proposal.

The delayed-choice scheme is implemented
as follows. Linearly polarized single photons are
sent by a polarization beamsplitter BS input
through an interferometer (length 48 m) with
two spatially separated paths associated with
orthogonal S and P polarizations (Fig. 2). The
movable output beamsplitter BS output consists of
the combination of a half-wave plate, a polarization beamsplitter BS′, an electro-optical modulaor (EOM) with its optical axis oriented at 22.5°
from input polarizations, and a Wollaston prism.
The two beams of the interferometer, which are
spatially separated and orthogonally polarized,
are first overlapped by BS′ but can still be
unambiguously identified by their polarization.
Then, the choice between the two interferometer
configurations, closed or open, is realized with
the EOM, which can be switched between two
different configurations within 40 ns by means of
a homebuilt fast driver: Either no voltage is
applied to the EOM, or its half-wave voltage V p is
applied to it. In the first case, the situation
corresponds to the removal of BS output and the
two paths remain uncombined (open configuration). Because the original S and P polarizations of the two paths are oriented along prism
polarization eigenstates, each “click” of one
detector D1 or D2 placed on the output ports is
associated with a specific path (path 1 or path 2,
respectively). When the V p voltage is applied, the
EOM is equivalent to a half-wave plate that
rotates the input polarizations by an angle of 45°.
The prism then recombines the two rotated
polarizations that have traveled along different
optical paths, and interference appears on the two
output ports. We then have the closed interferometer configuration.

Any description in
which light is treated as a classical wave, such as
the semiclassical theory with quantized photo-detectors , predicts that these numbers of
counts should obey the inequality
$$
\alpha=\frac{N_C\times N_T}{N_1\times N_2}\ge 1
$$
Violation of this inequality thus gives a quantitative criterion that characterizes nonclassical
behavior. For a single-photon wavepacket, quantum optics predicts perfect anticorrelation (i.e.,
a = 0) in agreement with the intuitive image that
a single particle cannot be detected simultaneously in the two paths of the interferometer
(2). We measured a = 0.12 ± 0.01, hence we are
indeed close to the pure single-photon regime.

Our realization of Wheeler’s delayed-choice
gedanken experiment demonstrates that the
behavior of the photon in the interferometer
depends on the choice of the observable that is
measured, even when that choice is made at a
position and a time such that it is separated from
the entrance of the photon into the interferometer
by a space-like interval.
