# Ruling Out Multi-Order Interference in Quantum Mechanics{{"Sinha2010"|cite}}

This article ruled out third- and higher-order interference and providing a bound on the accuracy of Born's rule.

The probability density to find
a particle at position $$\vec{r}$$ and at time $$t$$ is given by
$$
P(\vec{r}, t)=\Psi^* (\vec{r}, t)\Psi(\vec{r}, t)=|\Psi(\vec{r}, t)|^2
$$
A double-slit diffraction experiment is a direct
consequence of this rule; the probability to detect
a particle at r after passing through an aperture
with two slits, A and B, is given by
$$
\begin{align}
P_{AB}(\vec{r})&=|\Psi_A(\vec{r})+\Psi_B(\vec{r})|^2\\
&=|\Psi_A(\vec{r})|^2+|\Psi_B(\vec{r})|^2+\Psi_A^*(\vec{r})\Psi_B(\vec{r})+\Psi_A(\vec{r})\Psi_B^*(\vec{r})\\
&=P_A+P_B+I_{AB}
\end{align}
$$
The corresponding
(second-order) interference term can be defined as
$$
I_{AB}:=P_{AB}-P_A-P_B
$$
We define the third-
order interference term $$I_{ABC}$$ for a three-path
configuration (mutually exclusive) as the deviation of $$P_{ABC} $$ from the sum of the individual
probabilities and the second-order interference terms:
$$
I_{ABC}:=P_{ABC}-P_{AB}-P_{BC}-P_{AC}+P_A+P_B+P_C
$$

The nonzero interference term $$I_{AB}$$ is expected
in all wave theories, including quantum mechanics. The next higher-order (i.e., three-path)
interference term $$I_{ABC} $$ will be zero in all wave
theories, with a square-law relation between the
field energy (or probability density) and field amplitude, which is the case in quantum mechanics
with Born's rule. Moreover, if there is no interference at a certain level in the hierarchy, the
higher-order terms must vanish as well.



We expect the three-path interference term  $$I_{ABC} $$ to
be zero, with the advantage of being independent
of many experimental parameters, thus enabling a
more precise null test for Born's rule.
$$
\varepsilon =p_{ABC} − p_{AB} − p_{AC} − p_{BC}+p_A + p_B +
p_C − p_0
$$

$$
\begin{align}
\delta&=|I_{AB}|+|I_{BC}|+|I_{AC}|\\
&=|p_{AB}-p_A-p_B+p_0|+|p_{BC}-p_B-p_C+p_0|+|p_{AC}-p_A-p_C+p_0|
\end{align}
$$



To measure $$\kappa\equiv\frac{\varepsilon}{\delta}$$ in various optical power regimes, we used different types of photon sources.

With a null experiment, a very careful analysis
of random and systematic errors must be undertaken, as our bound on the amount of three-path
interference will be directly related to the level of
experimental uncertainty.



We are able to bound the magnitude of the
third-order interference term to less than $$10^{-2}$$ of
the regular expected second-order interference, at
several detector positions. Thus, our experiment
is able to rule out the existence of third-order in-
terference terms (and, in effect, any higher-order
interference terms) up to this bound.
