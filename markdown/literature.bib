  title       = {Polarized indistinguishable single photons from a quantum dot in an elliptical micropillar},
  abstract    = {The key challenge to scalable optical quantum computing, boson sampling, and quantum metrology is sources of single photons with near-unity system efficiency and simultaneously near-perfect indistinguishability in all degrees of freedom (including spectral, temporal, spatial, and polarization). However, previous high-indistinguishability solid-state single-photon sources had to rely on polarization filtering that reduced the system efficiency by at least 50%. Here, we overcome this challenge by developing a new single-photon source based on a coherently driven quantum dot embedded in an elliptical micropillar. The asymmetric cavity lifts the polarization degeneracy into two orthogonal linearly polarized modes with a suitable energy separation. We design an excitation-collection scheme that allows the creation and collection of single photons with an indistinguishability of 0.976(1) and a degree of polarization of 91%. Our method provides a solution of combining near-unity system efficiency and indistinguishability compatible with background-free resonant excitation, and opens the way to truly optimal single-photon sources for scalable photonic quantum technologies.},

  abstract    = {Entangled photon sources with simultaneously near-unity heralding efficiency and indistinguishability are the fundamental elements for scalable photonic quantum technologies. We design and realize a degenerate entangled-photon source from an ultrafast pulsed laser pumped spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), which show simultaneously ~97% heralding efficiency and ~96% indistinguishability between independent single photons. Such a high-efficiency and frequency-uncorrelated SPDC source allows generation of the first 12-photon genuine entanglement with a state fidelity of 0.572(24). We further demonstrate a blueprint of scalable scattershot boson sampling using 12 SPDC sources and a 12*12-modes interferometer for three-, four-, and five-boson sampling, which yields count rates more than four orders of magnitudes higher than all previous SPDC experiments. Our work immediately enables high-efficiency implementations of multiplexing, scattershot boson sampling, and heralded creation of remotely entangled photons, opening up a promising pathway to scalable photonic quantum technologies.},

  title        = {Resonance fluorescence from an atomic-quantum-memory compatible single photon source based on GaAs droplet quantum dots},
  abstract     = {Single photon sources, which are compatible with quantum memories are an important component of quantum networks. In this article, we show optical investigations on isolated GaAs/Al$_{0.25}$Ga$_{0.75}$As quantum dots grown via droplet epitaxy, which emit single photons on resonance with the Rb-87-D$_2$ line (780 nm). Under continuous wave resonant excitation conditions, we observe bright, clean and narrowband resonance fluorescence emission from such a droplet quantum dot. Furthermore, the second-order correlation measurement clearly demonstrates the single photon emission from this resonantly driven transition. Spectrally resolved resonance fluorescence of a similar quantum dot yields a linewidth as narrow as 660 MHz ($ 2.7~\mu eV $), which corresponds to a coherence time of 0.482 ns. The observed linewidth is the smallest reported so far for strain free GaAs quantum dots grown via the droplet method. We believe that this single photon source can be a prime candidate for applications in optical quantum networks.},

  title       = {Photonic Recurrent Ising Sampler},
  abstract    = {The failure of conventional electronic architectures to solve large combinatorial problems motivates the development of novel computational architectures. There has been much effort recently in developing photonic networks which can exploit fundamental properties enshrined in the wave nature of light and of its interaction with matter: high-speed, low-power, optical passivity, and parallelization. However, unleashing the true potential of photonic architectures requires the development of featured algorithms which largely exploit these fundamental properties. We here present the Photonic Recurrent Ising Sampler (PRIS), an algorithm tailored for photonic parallel networks that can sample combinatorially hard distributions of Ising problems, in a fast and efficient manner. The PRIS finds the ground state of general Ising problems and is able to probe critical behaviors of universality classes and their critical exponents. In addition to the attractive features of photonic networks, the PRIS relies on intrinsic dynamic noise to find ground states more efficiently.},
