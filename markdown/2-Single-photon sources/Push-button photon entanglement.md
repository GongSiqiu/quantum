# Push-button photon entanglement{{"Lu2014"|cite}}

The ideal source will have the following
four characteristics. (i) Deterministic
generation — on a pulsed excitation, the
source should emit one, and only one, pair
of entangled photons with a vanishingly
small chance of multi-pair emission. (ii)
High fidelity — the created two-photon state
should closely resemble the ideal desired
entangled state. (iii) Indistinguishability —
individual photons emitted in different trials
should be quantum mechanically identical to
each other. (iv) High collection efficiency —
radiated photons should be extracted with a
high efficiency so that they are not lost.



It is anticipated that s-shell resonant
excitation, a more controlled method
widely used in standard atomic physics
experiments, would overcome these
shortcomings, uncontrolled carrier recombination,
emission time jitter and reduced photon
indistinguishability,  and yield single photons of
better quality.



Going beyond single-photon generation,
Müller et al. have now taken another
step forward and produced entangled
photons using coherent excitation.

The
scheme is based on two-photon emission
from biexciton–exciton cascade radiative
decay in a single quantum dot. The key to the experiment is to
pump the single quantum dot to the
biexciton states. Müller and colleagues exploit a
more elegant excitation method — coherent
two-photon excitation . The photon energy
of a pulsed laser (yellow arrows in Fig. 1)
is set at the average energy of the biexciton
and exciton photons, in resonance
with the virtual biexciton two-photon
excitation state. An extra bonus of the two-photon
excitation scheme is that, because the laser
energy differs from both the biexciton and
exciton photons, the laser background can
be spectrally filtered out, without resorting
to a polarization suppression technique.



The approach of Müller
et al.  fulfils a number of criteria in the
wish list. The results are clear evidence for the
realization of a high-quality source of
entangled photons.
